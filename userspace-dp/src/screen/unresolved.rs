//! #7888: what the dataplane does with a zone whose screen reference does not
//! resolve.
//!
//! Extracted from `screen/mod.rs` when #7888 pushed that file past the 1500 LOC
//! [WATCH] threshold. `docs/engineering-style.md` says to split the module and
//! land the feature on the smaller pieces rather than clean up afterwards, so
//! this is a PURE MOVE -- no behaviour change -- committed separately from the
//! feature so the two can be reviewed apart.
//!
//! The unit is coherent on its own terms: a zone's screen reference has THREE
//! outcomes, and everything here exists to tell them apart and act on each.
//! Two of the three are faults with the same consequence (the #7168 substituted
//! conservative default) and different diagnoses, and keeping the diagnosis
//! decidable is why the two reference sets are separate maps rather than one
//! map with a flag.
//!
//! This is a CHILD module of `screen`, so it reaches `ScreenState`'s private
//! fields directly -- the split costs no visibility widening.
