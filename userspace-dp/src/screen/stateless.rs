/// one may be any size. So an IPv4 datagram whose length mod 1480 lands in 1-7
/// produces a perfectly legal 1-7 byte last fragment, which this check dropped
/// — and because the receiver's reassembly then times out, the WHOLE datagram
/// is lost. No attacker is required: any UDP application that fragments (DNS
/// with large responses, IKE, RADIUS, NFS, VXLAN, GTP) emits one for about
/// 0.5% of datagram sizes, deterministically per size, so an application with a
/// fixed message size is either always broken or never affected. Juniper
/// specifies `tear-drop` as OVERLAP detection ("when the sum of the offset and
/// size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next") and says
/// nothing about tiny tails, so xpf was dropping traffic SRX does not.
///
/// The discriminator was already in the struct and unused: `ip_frag_off` is the
/// raw field, so the More-Fragments bit is in hand at this check (IPv4 0x2000;
/// IPv6 the Fragment header's low bit). MF = 0 IS the last fragment and is the
/// one that may legally carry 1-7 bytes; MF = 1 with a sub-8-byte payload
/// really is malformed. The check now tests it.
///
/// What did NOT change: a non-first fragment with ZERO or under-length payload
/// is malformed whatever MF says — a last fragment that contributes no data is
/// not a legal tail, it is a fragment with nothing in it — so the #3027 arm and
/// its IPv6 analogue stay ungated.
///
/// This does NOT make the check an overlap detector. Detecting a real teardrop
/// needs offset/length state across fragments, and the only fragment-state
/// module in the tree (`fragment_assoc`) states in its own doc that it
/// ASSOCIATES rather than RFC-reassembles. That gap is a design limitation of a
/// stateless screen and is deliberately out of scope here; what is fixed is the
/// FALSE POSITIVE, which costs legal traffic on its own.
///
/// #3027: a non-first fragment whose `ip_total_len <= hdr_len` carries
/// zero (or, by the field's claimed length, "negative") payload. That is
/// even more clearly malformed than the classic tiny-but-positive
/// teardrop signature — exactly the kind of crafted fragment that
/// confuses downstream reassembly — yet the pre-#3027 code only entered
/// the payload-size branch when `ip_total_len > hdr_len`, so the
/// zero/under-length case slipped through as a PASS. Treat it as a

///
/// #3119: this check was IPv4-only while the sibling `check_ping_of_death`

/// `ip_payload_len - frag_data_off` (the L4/data region after the
/// extension headers up to and including the 8-byte fragment header).
/// `saturating_sub` collapses a hostile under-length (`frag_data_off`
/// larger than the declared `ip_payload_len`) to 0, which is `< 8` and so
