//! Channel-drain mechanics: move produced frames from the bounded mpsc channel
//! into the pending socket-write backlog and the replay buffer, merge the parked
//! ordered FullResync barrier (#5267), and drain the channel on shutdown.
//!
//! Pure code motion out of `mod.rs` (#6235); no logic change. The
//! `WRITE_BACKLOG_MAX_BYTES` cap (#2381/#4974) is enforced here on the UNWRITTEN
//! backlog length so a wedged reader cannot migrate the whole channel into the
//! heap-backed write backlog.

/// every cycle; the channel then refills from worker `try_send`, the loop drains
/// it again, and `write_buf` grows without bound → helper OOM / allocator
/// pressure on the forwarding plane. Halting the drain leaves the frames in the

/// `try_send` then fails and increments the existing `frames_dropped` / per-kind
/// `queue_full` counters (oldest queued/replay frames are preserved; newest
/// producer events are shed — keeping RT_FLOW current). Each pass that hits the
/// cap bumps `frames_write_stalled` so a wedged consumer is observable rather
/// than a silent OOM.

/// `WriteBacklog` `Vec` length: the cursor-backed backlog keeps a reclaimable
/// prefix of already-written bytes, so raw length can sit at ~2× pending until
/// the next geometric compaction. Measuring raw length would trip the cap early
/// and drift the pause/resume accounting.
