/// Authoritative "this protocol carries a rewritable 16-bit L4 port pair"
/// predicate (#3111). True only for TCP and UDP — the protocols whose L4
/// header begins with a source port at offset +0 and a destination port at
/// +2 that source/destination NAT may translate.
///
/// Everything else is port-less for NAT purposes and MUST NOT have its
/// first L4 bytes rewritten:
///   - GRE (47) / ESP (50) / AH (51) / OSPF (89) / ICMP / ... have no port
///     field; writing a pseudo-port at offset +0/+2 corrupts the L4 header
///     (ESP SPI high half, GRE flags/version, OSPF type), breaking the
///     tunnel/adjacency.
///   - protocol 0 is the "L4 tuple unknown" sentinel used by the
///     address-only `match_source_nat` callers.
///   - SCTP (132) does have ports, but a CRC32c checksum rather than the
///     internet checksum the incremental-delta rewriters assume, so SNAT
///     has never rewritten SCTP ports — keeping it out of this predicate
///     preserves that long-standing behavior (one source of truth shared
///     by the allocator and the packet rewriters so the two cannot drift).

/// (`"tcp"`, `"udp"`, `"icmp"`, `"icmp6"`/`"icmpv6"`, `"gre"`, ..., or a bare
/// 0-255 number). The Rust DNAT table used to recognize only `"tcp"`/`"udp"`
/// and silently DROP everything else (`_ => continue`), so a GRE/ICMP DNAT
/// rule compiled, committed, and never reached the dataplane. This resolver
/// mirrors the Go SSOT `appid.ProtocolNumber` (the table the commit-time gate
/// validates against) so the two views agree on the accepted set.
///
/// The specific `junos-*` protocol aliases the Go SSOT resolves
/// (`appid.ProtocolNumber`) are handled here too (#2505): a firewall
/// filter's `from protocol <token>` reaches the wire VERBATIM from the
/// parser (`compileFilterFrom` assigns `term.Protocol = nodeVal` with no
/// alias resolution), so a config `from protocol junos-gre` arrives as the
/// literal alias string. The Go filter commit gate
/// (`filterProtocolResolvable`, #2175/#2505) accepts exactly the
/// `appid.ProtocolNumber` set, so this resolver must accept the same aliases
/// or a gate-passing filter would silently lose its protocol constraint in
/// the dataplane (the #2505 fail-wide bug). An UNKNOWN `junos-foobar` is NOT
/// accepted (consistent with the gate, which rejects it). Returns `None` for
/// an unrecognized token; the DNAT commit gate
/// (validateDestinationNATProtocolStrict, #2396) and the filter commit gate
/// reject an unresolvable protocol so an inert rule never reaches the wire,
/// and the dataplane fails closed (rejecting the snapshot) on any that slip
/// through a tolerant load.
///
/// #2396 (Copilot fold): the token is trimmed and lower-cased before matching.
/// DNAT `match protocol` and an `application`'s `protocol` reach the wire
/// VERBATIM from the parser (`nodeVal`) — neither the parser nor the snapshot
/// builder normalizes — so a config `protocol GRE` or `protocol " icmp "`
/// would otherwise resolve to nothing here and be silently dropped. The Go
/// commit gate normalizes the same way (strings.TrimSpace + ToLower) before
/// validating, so the two views agree on the accepted set after normalization.
