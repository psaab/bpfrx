// #7212: the SIDE-EFFECT-FREE static input-filter verdict
// (`NonRoutingCountPolicy::Never` / `filter_ref_static_verdict`).
//
// The established-session-hit revalidation re-derives an ALREADY-ADMITTED
// session's input-filter verdict once per config generation. That packet is not
// a new arrival at the filter, so the re-derivation must charge nothing: a
// counting re-derivation would inflate every matched `then count` term by one
// packet per PERMITTED session per commit, which is the common case and would
// be silent.
//
