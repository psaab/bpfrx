//! #2410: validated narrowing newtypes for the forwarding-build trust
//! boundary.
//!
//! The Go control plane is the primary validator, but the Rust
//! forwarding-build conversion is the SECOND trust boundary: it must not
//! silently build a DIFFERENT config from a bad / mixed-version snapshot.
//! These newtypes decode a control-plane integer ONCE, with a checked
//! `try_*` conversion that returns a typed
//! [`crate::policy::SnapshotIntegrityError`] on an out-of-range value —
//! instead of the pre-fix unchecked `as` cast that silently WRAPPED
//! (`vlan 65537 → 1`, `ttl 256 → 0`) or the `filter_map` range check that
//! silently DROPPED an out-of-range CoS queue id.
//!
//! The valid path is byte-identical to the old cast: an in-range value
//! produces the same `u16`/`u8`. Only the out-of-range case changes — it
//! now fails the snapshot closed (the apply preflight keeps the previous
//! live forwarding state) rather than installing a wrapped/partial config.
