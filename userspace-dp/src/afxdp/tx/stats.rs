/// `u64::MAX` (see `umem.rs::TX_SIDECAR_UNSTAMPED`); a legitimate
/// monotonic timestamp cannot reach it (~585 years at ns granularity).
/// Previously, the Rust reviewer flagged the `ts == 0` branch as
/// in-band signalling on a u64. We now skip all sidecar writes on
/// clock failure rather than overwriting fresh data with the sentinel
/// — safe because `record_tx_completions_with_stamp` resets each
/// slot to `TX_SIDECAR_UNSTAMPED` on reap, so a frame whose sidecar
/// did NOT receive a stamp in the current cycle is already in the
/// correct "skip at reap time" state.

/// #812: stamp the submit-timestamp sidecar for the accepted prefix
/// of the current TX batch. Called ONCE per `writer.commit()` at each
/// of the six submit sites (plan §3.1 table) with the scratch
/// offsets. Only the first `inserted` offsets are stamped; the retry
/// tail (`scratch[inserted..]`) MUST NOT be stamped because those
/// descriptors return to `free_tx_frames` and would otherwise produce
/// phantom completions bucketed against a stale submit time.
///
/// Codex round-1 HIGH #1: call sites MUST invoke this AFTER
/// `writer.commit()` (and `drop(writer)`). Pre-commit stamping
/// attributed a scheduler preemption window between `insert` and ring
/// submission to the kernel-visible submit→completion latency, which
/// is exactly backwards. Post-commit stamping reflects the moment the
/// ring producer actually became kernel-visible.
///
/// Single-writer: the owner worker is the only thread that touches
/// this sidecar (see plan §3.3 file citations: `WorkerUmem` is `Rc`
/// at `umem.rs:16-18`, `free_tx_frames` is plain `VecDeque` at
/// `worker.rs:16`). Plain slice-indexed store — no atomic, no grow.
