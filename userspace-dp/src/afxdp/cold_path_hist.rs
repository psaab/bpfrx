//! #1612 step-3: cold-path latency histogram primitives.
//!
//! This module provides the math + helpers consumed by
//! `worker_cold_path.rs` (counter aggregation) and the cold-path
//! sampling site in `poll_descriptor/mod.rs`. Hot-path callers see:
//!
//! - `sample_tsc_start() -> u64` / `sample_tsc_end() -> u64` —
//!   asymmetric TSC read pair: start does `LFENCE; RDTSCP`, end does
//!   `RDTSCP; LFENCE`, both with `compiler_fence` brackets. Per
//!   Intel SDM §17.17 measurement-window recipe. Wrapper baseline
//!   ~25-40 ns on the loss cluster. (Codex code-r1 finding 1 +
//!   Copilot code-r1: the prior `sample_tsc()` alias was removed
//!   to prevent foot-gun usage at the end of a window.)
//! - `bucket_index_for_ns_48(ns)` — #1635 log-linear 48-bucket select:
//!   32 linear 16-ns buckets over `[0, 512)` ns + 15 pow-2 buckets over
//!   `[512, 2^24)` ns + 1 saturate bucket. Fixes the #1622 F1
//!   bucket-0 resolution floor (a 5-10× p50 error at low rule counts).
//! - `ColdPathSlotMap` + `lookup_slot(map, from, to)` — #1635 DIRECT
//!   `(from_zone_id, to_zone_id) → slot` map (256 slots) built at
//!   config apply. Replaces the splitmix64 16-slot hash that collided
//!   at 88.2% with 8 active zone-pairs (#1622 F2).
//!
//! Each slot keeps a `first_key` + `builder_collision` pair (renamed
//! from `alias_seen` per AGY r1 [1.6]). With the direct map a
//! `builder_collision` should NEVER fire — it indicates the snapshot
//! builder produced two distinct keys for one slot and is treated as a
//! hard error in operator dashboards.
