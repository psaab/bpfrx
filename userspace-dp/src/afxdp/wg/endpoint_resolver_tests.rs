//! #7158 endpoint-resolver tests.
//!
//! Hermetic: every fixture uses either an IP literal (which `to_socket_addrs`
//! parses without touching a resolver) or a syntactically invalid target (which
//! it rejects with `InvalidInput`, also without touching a resolver). No test
//! here depends on a name existing, on `/etc/hosts`, or on the sandbox having
//! working DNS — a resolver-dependent fixture would fail differently on a
//! developer box and in CI, and the failure would look like the code.
