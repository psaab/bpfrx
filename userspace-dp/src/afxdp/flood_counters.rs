//! #3651: per-zone SYN / ICMP / UDP flood-EVENT counters.
//!
//! The sibling of [`crate::afxdp::zone_counters`], for the other half of the
//! dead per-zone counter families the #3643 HIDE marked "not available". Where
//! the traffic half accounts forwarded VOLUME, this one accounts flood EVENTS
//! — as two separate triples, DROPS and (#7086) ALARMS:
//! the counts `show security screen ids-option statistics` renders as
//! "SYN flood events" / "ICMP flood events" / "UDP flood events" per zone
//! (`dataplane.FloodState.SynCount/ICMPCount/UDPCount`).
//!
//! ## This is NEW accounting, not a snapshot of existing state
//!
//! The screen module holds per-zone rate-LIMITER state (`screen/mod.rs`
//! `ZoneScreenState`) — token buckets and count-min sketches whose job is to
//! decide the next verdict, not to remember how many verdicts were taken. The
//! durable screen accounting that exists today is GLOBAL/per-reason
//! (`BatchCounters::record_screen_drop` → `screen_reason_drops`, #3343), never
//! per zone. So there was nothing to publish: this module is the per-zone tally
//! itself, added on the drop path.
//!
//! ## Two arms, never merged
//!
//! [`record_zone_flood_drop`] is called only from
//! [`crate::afxdp::BatchCounters::record_screen_drop`], i.e. only when a screen
//! check has already decided to DROP. That is off the forwarding fast path.
//!
//! [`record_zone_flood_alarm`] (#7086) is its counterpart on the
//! `alarm-without-drop` arm of `stage_screen_check`: the check TRIPPED, the
//! drop was suppressed, a log-only alarm was raised and the packet was
//! PERMITTED and forwarded. It accumulates into a SEPARATE triple and is never
//! folded into the drop counts — a counter whose name and call-site contract
//! say DROP must not report forwarded packets. Junos `alarm-without-drop`
//! suppresses the drop, not the statistic, so both arms are real flood events;
//! what differs is the disposition, and the surface needs to tell them apart.
//!
//! Note the alarm arm is the HOTTER of the two: `alarm-without-drop` is a
//! per-ZONE profile flag, so a zone in alarm mode suppresses every flood drop
//! it would take, and a volumetric flood runs that path per packet on every
//! worker with no drop thinning it. Both arms share the LUT, the per-zone
//! atomic block and the per-batch fold; only the destination triple differs.
//!
//! It is nevertheless coalesced per RX batch rather than `fetch_add`ing
//! directly, because a screen drop is not rare when it matters: a SYN flood is
//! the primary `screen_drops` trigger, so under volumetric attack this path
//! runs per packet on every worker at once. `stage_screen_check` already
//! documents that constraint for the aggregate (#1187 — unbatched atomics here
//! would MESI-ping-pong with the coordinator's status reads under attack), and
//! a per-ZONE tally would concentrate the contention harder still: every worker
//! hammering the ONE zone under attack. So this mirrors the zone-counter shape
//! exactly — flat `[u8; 65536]` zone-id → slot LUT, per-worker thread-local
//! dense accumulator, one per-RX-batch fold into per-zone atomics the slot map
//! cached at build time (lock-free, #5163).
//!
//! ## Store
//!
//! [`FloodCounterStore`] is zone-id keyed and rides `ForwardingState`, so a
//! surviving zone keeps the SAME atomic block across a config apply that
//! renumbers slots. `clear` zeroes the blocks IN PLACE (never drops the map
//! entry) so a live slot map's cached `Arc` keeps counting from zero — the
//! `clear_flood_counters` operator IPC.

///
/// Feeding the alarm arm into the drop counter would make a counter whose

///
/// ## Why it is batched, like the drop path and more so
///
/// `alarm-without-drop` is a per-ZONE profile flag (`ScreenProfile`), so a zone
/// in alarm mode suppresses EVERY flood drop it would otherwise take. Under a
/// volumetric flood this path therefore runs per packet on every worker at
/// once, with no drop to thin the traffic out — strictly hotter than the drop
/// path this mirrors, and exactly the MESI ping-pong against the coordinator's
/// status reads that #1187 documents. Hence the same flat-LUT lookup plus
/// thread-local accumulate, folded once per RX batch: no hash, no atomic, no

    //! ## Why there is no serialization guard here, and why none is needed
    //!
    //! These tests assert EXACT counter values, which is normally a #6819-class
    //! flake risk (concurrent tests mutating a shared counter). It is not one
    //! here, and the reason is worth recording so nobody adds a mutex that
    //! protects nothing — or, worse, deletes a test because they assume it is
    //! flaky.
    //!
    //! There is no process-global counter in this module. [`FloodCounterStore`]
    //! is an ordinary value; every test builds its own with
    //! `FloodCounterStore::default()`, so no two tests can reach the same
    //! totals. The only state that LOOKS shared is the [`FLOOD_PENDING`]
    //! thread-local accumulator.
    //!
    //! That one is per-test in practice: libtest runs each test on its own
    //! thread even under `--test-threads=1` (the `make test-rust` invocation),
    //! so each test gets a fresh `FLOOD_PENDING`. Verified directly rather than
    //! assumed — a probe pair in which the first test deliberately recorded
    //! WITHOUT flushing and the second flushed into a fresh store observed
    //! distinct thread ids and ZERO leaked rows.
    //!
    //! Two consequences. Residue cannot cross a test boundary, so a test that
    //! records without flushing cannot corrupt a neighbour. And a
    //! `record`/`flush` pair must still be matched WITHIN a test against the
    //! SAME slot map — the accumulator is slot-indexed, so flushing pending
    //! deltas through a DIFFERENT map mis-attributes them to whatever zone now
    //! owns that slot.
