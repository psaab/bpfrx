//! #3651: per-zone ingress/egress traffic (packet + byte) counters.
//!
//! The eBPF-era dense `zone_counters` BPF array was deleted in the #1476
//! retirement; the Go read surfaces (`show security zones` Traffic statistics,
//! REST `/security/zones`, the Prometheus collector) key a sparse offset map
//! and report `ErrCounterNotPopulated` ("not available") because nothing
//! sources per-zone volume. This module is the userspace POPULATE half
//! (design of record: `docs/research/3643-dead-counters/plan.md` §5A).
//!
//! ## Hot path (no per-packet hash, no per-packet atomic, no per-batch lock)
//!
//! [`ZoneCounterSlotMap`] is a flat direct-index `[u8; 65536]` zone-id → slot
//! LUT built at config-apply time. A forwarded packet resolves its ingress and
//! egress zone slot with two array reads (Codex+AGY r1 mandate: a per-packet
//! `HashMap::get` would throttle forwarding) and accumulates into a per-worker
//! thread-local dense [`ZonePending`] accumulator — the same coalesce-then-fold
//! technique `policy::record_policy_hit_counter` / `filter::record_filter_counter`
//! use. The per-RX-batch [`flush_recorded_zone_counters`] folds the coalesced
//! per-slot deltas into the shared per-zone atomics the slot map caches.
//!
//! ## Store (lock-free per-batch fold, mutex only off the hot path — #5163)
//!
//! Before #5163 the fold locked a single `Arc<Mutex<FxHashMap>>` on the shared
//! [`ZoneCounterStore`] EVERY RX batch on EVERY worker, so all RX queues
//! bounced one mutex cache line at line rate — cross-worker serialization on
//! the hot path. The store now holds one [`ZoneTotalsAtomic`] block PER zone id
//! (`Arc<Mutex<FxHashMap<u16, Arc<ZoneTotalsAtomic>>>>`) and the mutex guards
//! only the MAP STRUCTURE — get-or-create at config-apply, and iterate at
//! snapshot / clear / reconcile — all off the hot path (≤ once per commit or per
//! 1 s status poll). Each configured slot caches its zone's `Arc<ZoneTotalsAtomic>`
//! in the slot map at build time, so the per-batch fold is a straight `Relaxed`
//! `fetch_add` into per-zone atomics with NO lock and NO map lookup — exactly
//! the lock-free shared-counter shape the `policy`/`filter` hit counters already
//! use.
//!
//! The store stays keyed by the STABLE zone id, not by slot, so a config apply
//! that renumbers slots never mis-attributes counts: the slot map's cached
//! `Arc` is resolved from the zone-id-keyed store, so a surviving zone keeps the
//! SAME atomic block across applies (get-or-create returns the existing Arc)
//! while a renumbered slot simply points at that same stable block. That removes
//! the cold-path `zero_slot` reassignment machinery entirely. The store rides
//! `ForwardingState` (cloned forward from the previous state across applies,
//! like a persistent Arc) so totals survive config commits. `clear` resets each
//! zone's atomics IN PLACE (it must not drop the map entry, or a live slot map
//! would keep folding into an orphaned Arc that the snapshot no longer sees) so
//! the operator `clear_zone_counters` control IPC zeroes the totals while
//! forwarding keeps counting from zero.

    // pre-#5163 per-batch global-mutex fold makes AT LEAST the lock-freedom
    // test fail:
    //
    //   1. `concurrent_workers_fold_lock_free_without_lost_counts` — correctness
    //      of the new accumulation: N worker threads each fold M batches into
    //      the SHARED store concurrently; the merged total must equal N*M with
    //      no lost or double counts. (A broken fetch_add merge fails here; a
    //      mutex fold would also pass, so this is the correctness half.)
    //
    //   2. `worker_fold_makes_progress_while_status_reader_holds_the_lock` — the
    //      LOAD-BEARING structural assertion: while the ≤1 s status/clear path
    //      holds the shared store mutex, a worker's per-batch fold must still
    //      COMPLETE promptly. The lock-free fold `fetch_add`s into the slot
    //      map's cached atomics and returns in microseconds. Reverting to the
    //      per-batch-global-mutex fold makes the fold BLOCK on the held mutex
    //      until the reader releases (300 ms here), so the `< 150 ms` bound
    //      FAILS — a clean assertion failure, not a hang (the holder always
    //      releases).
