// #6431: classification of the Interrupt-mode idle-regulation `poll(2)`
// return in the AF_XDP worker loop.
//
// Interrupt poll-mode has exactly ONE backoff: the blocking `poll()` itself,
// with an `INTERRUPT_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS` (1 ms) timeout. Discarding its return
// conflates outcomes that need different handling:
//
//   rc == 0                    timeout — the wait waited          -> resume
//   rc  > 0, POLLIN set        a queue is readable                -> resume
//   rc == -1, EINTR            a signal cut the wait short        -> retry
//   rc == -1, any other errno  the call fails and keeps failing   -> BACK OFF
//   rc  > 0, only error bits   POLLNVAL / POLLERR / POLLHUP       -> BACK OFF
//
// The last two rows are the bug. Both return IMMEDIATELY and keep doing so, so
// the 1 ms floor disappears and the idle path becomes a hot spin on a pinned
// worker core. Measured on this kernel with the production 1 ms timeout: a
// healthy idle poll yields ~950 loops/s; the same loop over a closed fd yields
// ~2.96M loops/s — a ~3120x amplification, held for as long as the condition
// lasts. `Degraded` therefore tells the caller to substitute its own sleep,
// which restores exactly the duty cycle the healthy path has.
//
// `EINTR` deliberately does NOT back off. A signal-interrupted wait is normal
// here — the helper installs a `ctrlc` handler (`server/lifecycle.rs`), and
// `poll(2)` is one of the calls `SA_RESTART` never restarts (signal(7)) — and
// the caller re-enters the blocking poll on its next pass, so the retry costs
// one work scan, not a spin. Treating it as an error would add a sleep to
// ordinary signal delivery; treating it as readiness would busy-loop.
