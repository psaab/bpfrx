//! #959 Phase 7 — extracts the per-binding TX pipeline state out of
//! `BindingWorker` into a dedicated `WorkerTxPipeline` sub-struct.
//!
//! These seven fields hold the per-binding TX pipeline buffers and
//! the per-frame submit-timestamp sidecar:
//!
//! - `free_tx_frames` — UMEM frame addresses available for TX.
//! - `pending_tx_prepared` — TX-ready requests awaiting ring submit.
//! - `pending_tx_local` — local-TX requests awaiting ring submit.
//! - `max_pending_tx` — TX backpressure threshold (configured once).
//! - `pending_fill_frames` — fill-ring back-pressure queue.
//! - `in_flight_prepared_recycles` — completion-time recycle map.
//! - `tx_submit_ns` — per-UMEM-frame submit timestamp sidecar
//!   (#812). Pre-allocated to total UMEM frames at construction;
//!   never grown. `Box<[u64]>` (not `Vec<u64>`) at the type level
//!   so any future `push` attempt fails to compile.
//!
//! Pure structural extraction: capacities and access semantics
//! unchanged from master pre-Phase-7. Field names preserved so
//! `binding.tx_pipeline.free_tx_frames` keeps the same grep-friendly
//! suffix as the original `binding.free_tx_frames`.
//!
//! NOT IN THIS PHASE: `outstanding_tx` (collides with the
//! `BindingStatus.outstanding_tx` snapshot mirror; deferred to a
//! tiny followup phase that handles the type disambiguation).
