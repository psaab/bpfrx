// #9168 — the kernel RX counters must have a PRODUCER, not just a consumer.
//
// `kernel_rx_dropped` and `kernel_rx_invalid_descs` were plumbed end to end
// (atomic -> snapshot -> wire -> Go decode -> `Kernel RX dropped:` in
// `pkg/monitoriface/monitor.go`) and never written. The worker sampled
// `statistics_v2()` once per second per binding and stored one of its six
// counters. `show` / `monitor` therefore reported a permanent hard 0.
//
// A CONSUMER TEST CANNOT SEE THIS. The pre-existing #802 cell
// (`ring_pressure_counters_round_trip_through_snapshot`) stores a value into
// the atomic itself and asserts the snapshot carries it — it is green whether
// or not anything in production ever stores. So the cells here are
// producer-side, and one of them binds the CALL SITE rather than the function:
// a package's own cells can prove `publish_kernel_xdp_statistics` behaves and
// say nothing about whether the worker loop calls it.
