// #9168: publish the kernel's AF_XDP socket statistics into the per-binding
// atomics the status/monitor chain already reads.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `kernel_rx_dropped` and `kernel_rx_invalid_descs`
// were plumbed end to end — atomics here, snapshot fields, wire encoding, Go
// decode, and the `Kernel RX dropped:` / `Kernel RX invalid:` lines in
// `pkg/monitoriface/monitor.go` — and NOTHING ever wrote the producer end. The
// worker loop sampled `statistics_v2()` once per second per binding and stored
// exactly one of the six counters it returns, discarding the rest. So an
// operator saw a permanent hard `0` on both lines: the value that is
// indistinguishable from healthy, on the instrument that exists to reveal a
// NIC dropping every packet. That is the observability form of a fail-open.
//
// WHY THIS IS A DESTRUCTURE AND NOT THREE `store` CALLS AT THE SAMPLE SITE.
// The defect was a field with a complete consumer and no producer, and nothing
// could have caught it: a consumer test passes on a hard zero, and a producer
// that simply forgets a field compiles. An exhaustive destructure of
// `XdpStatisticsV2` makes forgetting one a COMPILE ERROR — a field added to
// the kernel-statistics struct cannot reach the wire unwritten, because it
// cannot reach this function unnamed.
