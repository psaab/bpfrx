    /// session creates produced 25.26M deltas of which 23.29M (92%) were
    /// dropped, and with the generator stopped and `active_flow_count = 0` the
    /// helper kept generating ~149k deltas/s and dropping ~136k/s for ~90 s,
    /// ending only as the owned sessions aged out. The signature was decisive:
    /// 32.68M dropped session-CREATE deltas against 52k dropped closes, from
    /// 32,768 real creates — re-exported opens, not traffic.
    ///
    /// Why not-arming is also the CORRECT answer and not merely the loop-safe
    /// one: the recovery for a dropped delta is an OPEN-ONLY snapshot of the
    /// owned set. It cannot restore a dropped CLOSE however many times it runs,
    /// and every OPEN it could restore is already in the snapshot being shipped.
    /// Re-running it on its own overflow recovers nothing.
    ///
    /// This does NOT suppress a genuinely-new incremental drop, and that is a
    /// property of WHERE the marker lives rather than of timing: it is set by
    /// the delta's producer (`SessionTable::emit_open_delta_with_origin`, whose
    /// only production caller is the worker loop's chunked owner-RG export), so
    /// an incremental open/close interleaved with the export is unmarked and
    /// still arms. An earlier revision of this fix passed the flag at the flush
    /// CALL SITE and had to argue the worker loop's single-threadedness to reach
    /// the same conclusion; that form is also the one where a future drain site
    /// passing the wrong flag silently suppresses a real arm.
