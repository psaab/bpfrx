//! #5288: bounded, per-worker rate limiter for kernel neighbor-table
//! programming on the data-path ARP/NDP learn.
//!
//! ## Why
//! `stage_link_layer_classify` learns a dynamic neighbor from every accepted
//! ARP reply / NDP Neighbor Advertisement and then calls
//! [`super::neighbor::add_kernel_neighbor`], which — per accepted advert —
//! allocates request + IP `Vec`s, opens a raw `AF_NETLINK` socket, `sendto`s
//! an `RTM_NEWNEIGH`, and closes the socket synchronously ON THE XSK WORKER.
//! Before this limiter the call fired UNCONDITIONALLY, even for a same-key /
//! same-MAC repeat whose `insert_if_changed` result was discarded. An attacker
//! streaming valid ARP replies / NAs for a non-owned unicast IP therefore drove
//! a `socket()`/`sendto()`/`close()` + allocations per frame — forwarding
//! starvation on the affected queues (a DoS amplification).
//!
//! ## What this bounds
//! A fixed-size, SET-ASSOCIATIVE table of [`KERNEL_NEIGH_LIMITER_BUCKETS`]
//! buckets, each holding [`KERNEL_NEIGH_LIMITER_WAYS`] ways
//! ([`KERNEL_NEIGH_LIMITER_SLOTS`] slots total). Each way records the last
//! `(key -> mac)` this worker actually programmed and WHEN. The decision
//! ([`KernelNeighborProgramLimiter::should_program`]) is a pure function of the
//! bucket + the advert, with no allocation and no syscall, so it is
//! unit-testable in isolation (the syscall stays in `add_kernel_neighbor`).
//!
//! * **Same-key/same-MAC repeat** → skipped. The owning way already records the
//!   exact binding, and/or the authoritative userspace neighbor map was
//!   unchanged by this advert (`map_changed == false`), which proves the kernel
//!   was already told. This is the primary amplification fix.
//! * **Changed-flood (MAC cycling on one IP)** → those adverts all map to the
//!   SAME key's way, which drives at most one kernel program per
//!   [`KERNEL_NEIGH_MIN_INTERVAL_NS`].
//! * **Many-distinct-IP flood** → because the table is FIXED size, the
//!   AGGREGATE per-worker netlink rate is bounded to
//!   `≤ SLOTS / MIN_INTERVAL` programs regardless of how many distinct source
//!   IPs an attacker cycles: each way programs at most once per interval, and a
//!   colliding genuine change never evicts a way that is still within its
//!   interval (see below), so the fixed way count is the hard cap.
//!
//! ## Not losing a real change — even under a colliding-key flood (#6129)
//! A genuine MAC change (`map_changed == true`) is guaranteed to reach the
//! kernel within a bounded number of ticks:
//! * **Key owns a way** → the change is programmed immediately unless it is
//!   inside one interval of that way's last program, in which case the way
//!   keeps the OLD mac so the binding stays "owed" and is retried on the next
//!   advert once the interval elapses — even a same-MAC advert the userspace
//!   map already absorbed (`map_changed == false`). Steady-state re-adverts
//!   return early WITHOUT touching the timestamp, so a real change after a
//!   quiet period programs on its first advert.
//! * **Key owns NO way (the #6129 collision case)** → a foreign key occupying
//!   this key's bucket can no longer starve it. Instead of contending for a
//!   single direct-mapped slot, the genuine change CLAIMS a way in the bucket:
//!   a never-fired way if one is free, else the least-recently-programmed way.
//!   It then OWNS that way and is owed-tracked thereafter. A single colliding
//!   key A therefore cannot keep victim B out — B lands in a different way and
//!   programs. Up to `WAYS - 1` distinct foreign keys may be simultaneously hot
//!   in a bucket before a genuine victim change can be delayed, and even then
//!   only until one of those ways ages past its interval.
//!
//! The claim step still honors the rate cap on the way it evicts (a way within
//! its interval is NOT evicted), so the aggregate netlink rate stays bounded to
//! `≤ SLOTS / MIN_INTERVAL` — the #5288 property is preserved: an adversarial
//! flood of repeated/colliding adverts with no genuine change still programs
//! O(1), and a distinct-genuine-change flood is still capped by the fixed way
//! count, not O(adverts). Any residual kernel-table lag self-heals via
//! `NUD_STALE` + on-demand kernel ARP on the host path.
//!
//! ## Placement
//! Per-worker, owned by [`super::worker::BindingWorker`] and touched ONLY by the
//! owning worker thread (the ARP/NDP learn runs on the XSK poll loop), so no
//! `Arc`/`Mutex`/cross-core sync — consistent with the per-queue AF_XDP model
//! and the sibling `pending_neigh` / `neg_neigh_cache` per-worker structures.
//! Neighbor programming is a LOCAL kernel-table operation; it is NOT HA /
//! session-sync state, so a per-worker limiter needs no peer coordination.
//!
//! Persistent-socket + off-worker coalescing of the netlink send itself is a
//! deferred follow-up (out of scope for #5288); this limiter only ensures a
//! repeat/flood no longer does unbounded socket work on the XSK worker.
