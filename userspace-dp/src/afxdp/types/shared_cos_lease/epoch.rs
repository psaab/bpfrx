// #2158 (P2): #1229 Phase 6 v8 epoch-state cluster, extracted from
// shared_cos_lease/mod.rs as a pure code-motion split. Type/impl/const
// bodies are byte-identical to the pre-split form; atomic memory
// orderings and the seqlock contract are preserved exactly.
//
// VISIBILITY WIDENING (the only non-move edits in this file):
// the lease/rotation/publish logic lives in sibling submodules
// (`lease.rs`, `rotate_epoch_v8.rs`, `publish_equal_flow_epoch_v8.rs`).
// In Rust a private item is visible only within its defining module and
// that module's *descendants*; a sibling submodule is NOT a descendant.
// Before this split these epoch types were defined in the parent
// (`mod.rs`), so every descendant submodule saw their inherent-private
// fields for free. Moving the definitions into this child submodule makes
// those fields private-to-`epoch`, so each item a sibling reaches across
// the new file boundary is widened from inherent-private to `pub(super)`
// — the SAME minimal widening the already-extracted `rotate_epoch_v8.rs`
// / `publish_equal_flow_epoch_v8.rs` (PR #1588) documented. No new `pub`
// / `pub(crate)` surface; no cross-crate change. The exhaustive widening
// list is recorded inline at each item below and summarized in the PR.
//
// The mode/cause/fail-open enums that are part of the lease's public-to-
// afxdp surface keep their original `pub(in crate::afxdp)` visibility
// (they are re-exported by `types/mod.rs` and consumed across afxdp).

// Plan: docs/pr/1229-cross-worker-vtime/phase6-fair-lease.md (commit
// c159dbd5+, PLAN-READY at task-mowjwl1o-ob7bc5).
//
// Mechanism: 200µs epochs; per-worker fair share = (my_active_flows *
// epoch_total_grant_cap) / total_active_flow_buckets. Linearizable
// class CAS via packed (epoch_tag, total_granted). Tag-checked
// per-worker grants via packed (epoch_tag, worker_granted) — eliminates
// cross-epoch fetch_add contamination. Two-CAS-with-rollback for
// outstanding-leased cap (legacy state.credits accounting). Bounded
// rollback retries. Seqlock-style rotation: epoch_seq EVEN→ODD→EVEN.
// Surplus claiming opens only when the CPU-bound bypass detector arms;
// the 100µs grace timestamp remains part of the bypass telemetry and
// legacy detector history. Rate-cap clamped via
// elapsed_ns.min(EPOCH_DURATION_NS).

/// Epoch duration. Picked to match existing refill cadence.
