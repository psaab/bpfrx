// #6310: per-worker copy-buffer pool for the cross-worker CoS
// prepared-redirect path.
//
// The two cross-binding prepared-redirect sites in `cross_binding.rs`
// (`redirect_prepared_cos_request_to_owner{,_binding}`) must hand OWNED
// bytes to the owner worker: the source UMEM frame is recycled the
// instant the request is enqueued (see
// `recycle_prepared_immediately_with_shared`), but the owner worker
// consumes the bytes ASYNCHRONOUSLY on its own thread — it drains the
// per-binding `pending_tx` MPSC inbox, re-ingests the request into a CoS
// queue, and only copies the bytes into a UMEM TX frame at drain/settle
// time (`copy_from_slice(&req.bytes)`). The copy is therefore genuinely
// required (a shared scratch reused per-packet would be overwritten
// before the owner reads it, and shared-UMEM is not universal, so an
// offset hand-off is not always sound). Before this fix each redirect
// paid a fresh `frame.to_vec()` heap allocation at packet rate on the
// cross-worker arm — the same warmed-path allocation class as the CoS
// cohort #4972 / #4973 / #5189, but these two sites were never
// enumerated there.
//
// The pool is a bounded, per-worker THREAD-LOCAL free-list of byte
// buffers. `checkout` reuses a pooled allocation (retained capacity)
// instead of allocating; `recycle` returns a finished buffer for reuse.
// It is replenished by recycling committed CoS local-TX buffers at the
// exact-Local settle sites (`settle_exact_local_fifo_submission` /
// `settle_exact_local_scratch_submission_flow_fair`), which run on the
// owner worker AFTER the bytes have already been copied into UMEM — so a
// recycled buffer is always dead.
//
// Soundness of the cross-worker hand-off: the pool is thread-local, so
// no two workers ever touch the same pool. A checked-out buffer is
// MOVED into the `TxRequest` and travels to the owner inside the
// single-owner MPSC inbox; the owner later MOVES its bytes into its OWN
// thread-local pool at settle. Ownership is always exclusive (Rust move
// semantics + the inbox single-consumer invariant): no aliasing, no
// data race, no use-after-free. Buffers migrate from redirect sources to
// owners; under the symmetric cross-worker CoS spread this fix targets
// (every worker both sources redirects and owns shaped queues) each
// worker's pool stays replenished and the warmed redirect path is
// allocation-free. A pathologically asymmetric pattern just falls back
// to allocating on the depleted side and caps the buffer count on the
// other — bounded and self-healing, never incorrect.
