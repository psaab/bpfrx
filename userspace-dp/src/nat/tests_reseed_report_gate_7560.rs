//! #7560 residual: the report GATE, not the counters.
//!
//! #8235 shipped the lease counters and a note for them, and left the gate
//! alone. The gate was already wrong at two of the three `reseed_retained_from`
//! call sites:
//!
//!   - `nat64.rs` gated on `reseeded || skipped_out_of_range || refused` and
//!     omitted `skipped_address_only` ENTIRELY, so a pass that skipped only
//!     address-only tokens counted them and then printed nothing;
//!   - the #6979 rename site always printed a line but left that count out of
//!     the message.
//!
//! Both are the same shape: the condition and the text are restated at each
//! caller, so a field added to `ReseedOutcome` has to be added in three places,
//! and was not — twice. Correcting the two sites would leave three places to
//! forget next time. `needs_report()` derives the gate from the struct so a
//! silently-ungated population is unrepresentable.
//!
//! These cells are about the GATE. The counters and the note are #8235's and
//! are tested there; nothing here re-tests them.
