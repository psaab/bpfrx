// #8115 R1 — the ADDRESS-ONLY route to the pool-vs-pool duplicate identity.
//
// #6979 F6 (PR #8111) closed one route: a LOCAL, port-translating (PAT) mint
// may not publish a `(pool address, port)` a PEER pool's occupancy bitmap
// already holds. That check asks the bitmap, and the bitmap is only ONE of the
// two ownership tokens this allocator issues.
//
// A `port no-translation` flow, or a port-less protocol, takes the ADDRESS-ONLY
// path: it claims NO occupancy bit and instead owns an entry in
// `address_only_owners`, keyed by the full reverse identity
// `(protocol, translated ip, translated port, dst ip, dst port)`. The two
// spaces never met, so BOTH directions were open:
//
//   - a peer pool preserving `X:P` toward `R` did not stop a PAT mint of `X:P`
//     toward `R`;
//   - two address-only flows in DIFFERENT pools over one address collided
//     whenever protocol and remote matched.
//
// # Population
//
// Same as F6's, and verified rather than assumed: the Go #5144 gate
// (`validateNATPoolExternalTupleOverlapStrict`) rejects overlapping pools at
// commit on address overlap alone, so an overlapping config arrives only from
// the tolerant load / peer-sync path (`lenientCompileOpts`, wired at
// `configstore.Store` load and SyncApply). That path is real, and its own
// compiler doc records the part that makes this worth fixing: unlike
// `lenientNPTv6` / `lenientNAT64Prefix`, "the dataplane does NOT reject the
// overlapping snapshot — the overlap installs with a LATENT collision".
//
// # The two sub-questions are not equally precise
//
// The bitmap question is REMOTE-AGNOSTIC and the address-only question is
// REMOTE-SPECIFIC. The controls below are what hold that line: a peer
// address-only identity toward a DIFFERENT remote is not a wire collision and
// must still translate. Overlapping pools are a shape this dataplane
// deliberately supports, so nothing may stop translating that is not an actual
// duplicate.

//
// # Why refusing is not a new policy
//
// The issue calls this "a decision, not a patch", because the synced path

//
//   1. This function ALREADY refuses this exact conflict when it happens inside

//      the peer query in makes the two-allocator case behave like the
//      one-allocator case; it does not introduce a new answer.
//   2. `Refused` is OBSERVABLE by construction: `may_publish()` is false, the
//      caller turns it into `SyncedImportOutcome::RejectedReserve`, and
//      `xpf_userspace_synced_import_reserve_refused_total` counts it — a metric
//      whose help text already says those flows will not survive a failover
//      (#8101). "Surface the conflict rather than silently reserve" is exactly
//      what `Refused` already means here.
//
// The alternative — import anyway — is the LATENT loss the #6979 F1 comment
// measured three steps of: the import is accepted into the wrong allocator, the
// squatter retires, and the first allocator re-issues an identity the imported
// flow is still live on.
