//! #8447: the persistent-NAT admission counter pair.
//!
//! The cluster measurement that found #8447 could see only that no session
//! installed. It could not say whether the allocator REFUSED the flow or
//! installed it and immediately reclaimed it, and those have different fixes.
//! These counters make that difference readable — and readable from a Rust
//! test, so every future question about this path does not need the shared
//! cluster's lock.
//!
//! BOTH ARMS ARE COUNTED, and that is the point rather than symmetry for its
//! own sake. A lone "declined" counter reading zero is equally consistent with
//! "nothing was declined" and with "this path never ran", which are the two
//! answers the question is between. Only a non-zero `admitted` alongside it
//! rules the second out.
