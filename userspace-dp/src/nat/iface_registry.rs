//! #6751 PR 2/3: the interface-mode source-NAT translated-identity registry.
//!
//! Interface SNAT rewrites the source ADDRESS to the egress interface's own
//! address and — before this module — PRESERVED the source port
//! unconditionally, minting no allocation, no reservation and no occupancy
//! token of any kind. Two internal hosts that picked the same source port to
//! the same server therefore produced ONE external five-tuple, and the reply
//! `(S:80 -> E:5555)` carries no field that can tell them apart. The 1:N
//! reverse index keeps both forward handles and `reply_matches_forward_session`
//! validates BOTH, so every reply for the ambiguous tuple was un-NAT'd to
//! whichever session was installed first: H2's return traffic delivered to H1.
//!
//! The remedy is the one the pool-mode address-only path already ships
//! (#5269/#5336/#5341/#6041/#6226): an identity-keyed occupancy token on the
//! FULL reverse identity `(protocol, translated ip, translated port, remote ip,
//! remote port)`, minted at admission, released by the existing teardown path.
//! What interface mode adds on top is the PAT fallback: pool mode denies a
//! colliding address-only flow as exhaustion because it cannot move the port,
//! while interface mode CAN move it — so the LATER collider is PAT'd onto a
//! free port instead of being dropped. Preserve-first keeps the wire
//! byte-identical for every non-colliding flow, which is the intentional xpf
//! semantic (Junos allocates unconditionally; see the issue's Junos-parity
//! note).
//!
//! # Why a registry rather than a rule-carried allocator
//!
//! Interface mode has NO pool: `rewrite_src` is the egress interface's own
//! address, and the reverse-lookup namespace it lands in is global BY ADDRESS
//! (`session/key.rs` keys on the wire tuple; nothing carries ingress interface,
//! zone or VRF onto the reverse path — that is open #2387). Two different
//! interface-mode rules that egress the same interface therefore share one
//! identity space, and a per-rule allocator would let each mint the same
//! identity. The registry keys ONE `PortAllocator` per egress ADDRESS, which is
//! exactly the granularity of the ambiguity being removed.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! Node-lifetime. The registry is held as an `Arc` on `ForwardingState` and
//! CARRIED OVER on every apply (`build_forwarding_state_*` passes
//! `Some(&self.forwarding)`), the same way `parse_source_nat_rules_with_previous`
//! carries pool allocators and `Nat64State::from_snapshots_with_previous`
//! carries NAT64 allocators. Rebuilding it on commit would drop the occupancy of
//! every live session and let a fresh flow preserve an identity that is still on
//! the wire — the exact defect this closes.
