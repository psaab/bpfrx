// #4800: tests for the SNAT pool allocator's `live` map-mutex contention
// accounting — the NAT-allocator leg of the new-flow-install ceiling
// instrumentation.
//
// The measurement these back exists to settle a specific question: at a
// sustained new-flow rate, is the residual Phase-1 (#2852) map mutex a
// material contributor, or do `publish_shared_session` and the N-way
// `replicate_session_upsert` fan-out saturate first? That question has an
// answer only if the allocator reports BOTH how often it took the mutex and
// how often it had to block, so every test here treats the two as a pair.
//
// `PortAllocator` instances are per-test, so these assertions are exact:
// unlike the process-global publish/replication counters, no concurrently
// running test can touch this allocator's atomics.
