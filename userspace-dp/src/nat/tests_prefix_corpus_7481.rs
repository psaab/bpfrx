// #7481: the Rust half of the shared NAT match-prefix corpus differential.
//
// The Go gate (`natMatchPrefixParses`) claimed by COMMENT to mirror the Rust
// parsers "EXACTLY". It did not, and the divergence was found by reading the two
// implementations side by side rather than by any test:
//
//   10.0.0.0/+24   Go reject   ipnet reject   static_nat ACCEPT
//   10.0.0.0/024   Go ACCEPT   ipnet REJECT   static_nat ACCEPT
//
// The second was listed as a control that AGREED. It did not, and it is the
// worse one: `/024` passed an ordinary strict commit and was then dropped by
// `parse_match_prefix` — a fail-closed drop, so the rule matched NOTHING.
//
// THIS FILE AND `pkg/config/nat_match_prefix_corpus_7481_test.go` READ THE SAME
// FILE. Two hand-maintained lists is the disease this issue is about, one layer
// up: a literal added to the corpus is asserted in both languages, and a
// literal only one side knows about cannot exist.
