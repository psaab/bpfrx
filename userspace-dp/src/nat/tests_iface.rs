// #6751 PR 2/3: interface-mode source-NAT translated-identity admission.
//
// The defect these pin: interface SNAT preserved the source port
// unconditionally, so two internal hosts that picked one source port to one
// server produced BYTE-IDENTICAL reverse wire keys and both forward sessions
// validated against a reply. Every reply reached whichever session installed
// first — H2's return traffic delivered to H1.
//
// The remedy: reserve the translated reverse identity at admission, PRESERVE
// the port when that identity is free, PAT the LATER collider when it is not.
