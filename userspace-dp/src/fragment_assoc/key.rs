/// Parse the port-free fragment fields from an L3-relative packet: the
/// `(key, more, offset_units)` triple. `addr_family` selects the family. Shared
/// by [`nat64_first_fragment_key`] and [`nat64_nonfirst_fragment_key`] so the
/// install and consult key derivations are byte-identical.
///
/// #5798: `authority` is the ingress security domain the caller resolved for
/// THIS packet (see [`FragAuthority`]). It is stamped verbatim into the key so
/// install and consult agree by construction; this ONE builder is the SSOT for
/// both derivations, so the two can never drift into keying on different
/// dimensions. Every other field is read from the packet's L3 headers only —
/// no payload byte is interpreted as L4.
