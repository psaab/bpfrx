//! Fairness regime computations per `docs/fairness-regimes.md`.
//!
//! These are pure functions (no I/O, no global state) used by:
//! - the production harness `fairness-eval` binary that consumes
//!   iperf3 JSON + scraped Prometheus metrics and emits the
//!   contract gates' verdict
//! - tests that pin the contract's worked-example table to its
//!   numeric values (single source of truth for the math)
//!
//! See `docs/pr/1219-fairness-harness/plan.md` for design.
