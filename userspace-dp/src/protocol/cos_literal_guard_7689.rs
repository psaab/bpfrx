//! #7689: keep additive-wire struct literals non-exhaustive.
//!
//! Two cells. The first pins `CoSSchedulerSnapshot` at ZERO exhaustive
//! literals — it was the tree's outlier at 97% and the struct that paid #6846's
//! 71-literal toll. The second is a per-struct RATCHET over the whole
//! additive-wire population, added when the same shape turned up in four
//! structs in a single session. Its header explains why the obvious
//! generalisation of that observation is wrong.
//!
//! An ADDITIVE wire field — one carrying `#[serde(default)]`, designed to be
//! invisible to older peers — is a compile break at every **exhaustive** struct
//! literal, i.e. every literal with no `..Default::default()` tail. Those
//! literals do not care about the new field; they break only because they
//! enumerate.
//!
//! `CoSSchedulerSnapshot` was the tree's outlier: 72 of 74 literals enumerated
//! (97%), against 1 of 402 for `InterfaceSnapshot` and 12 of 330 for
//! `FirewallTermSnapshot`. #6846 paid that toll — two new fields broke 71
//! literals across five files — and #7689 converted them. This is the second
//! half of #7689's acceptance: the cell that stops the pattern coming back,
//! because the habit is what regrows it.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT `#[non_exhaustive]`. That would force the tail at compile
//! time, but it also blocks exhaustive construction outside the defining crate
//! and changes the type's public contract to solve a test-hygiene problem.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// #7689 GENERALISED: the same tax, measured across the whole additive-wire
// population rather than the one struct that paid it loudest.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY THE OBVIOUS GENERALISATION IS WRONG, measured before building this.
//
// The prompt for this was four structs needing `..Default::default()` in one
// session: `CoSSchedulerSnapshot`, `StageSeed`, `ProcessStatus` and
// `WorkerRuntimeCounters`. Four instances looks like a class. It is two.
//
//   CoSSchedulerSnapshot  13 fields  serde(default)  -> additive WIRE type
//   ProcessStatus        153 fields  serde(default)  -> additive WIRE type
//   StageSeed              4 fields  no derives      -> test-harness struct
//   WorkerRuntimeCounters 20 fields  no serde at all -> internal counters
//
// The tax #7689 describes is specific: an ADDITIVE wire field carries
// `#[serde(default)]` precisely so an older peer never sees it, so a test
// literal breaking on it is pure friction with no review value. For a
// NON-wire struct the opposite holds — adding a field is an ordinary breaking
// change, and the compile error at each site is review pressure worth keeping.
// Forcing `..Default::default()` onto `WorkerRuntimeCounters` would REMOVE a
// signal rather than remove a cost.
//
// So a guard scoped to all four would be scoped to a class that does not
// exist, and would actively weaken review on two of them.
//
// AND THE NAIVE POPULATION IS UNSHIPPABLE. "Every struct with a Default impl"
// is 240 structs, 130 of which have at least one exhaustive literal, totalling
// **1497** literals. Most are harmless: `FirewallFilterSnapshot` is 276 of 276
// exhaustive and costs nothing, because it has three fields and does not grow.
// Exhaustiveness is only a tax on a struct that GAINS fields.
//
// The population below is therefore: a Default impl, at least one
// `#[serde(default)]` field, and >= 8 fields. That is 124 literals across 23
// structs — tractable, and every one of them is a type designed to grow.
//
// WHY A RATCHET RATHER THAN AN ASSERTION OF ZERO. Converting 124 literals now
// is a mechanical change across 23 structs and five subsystems, with real
// conflict surface against every lane. The ceiling table records today's count
// per struct and only ever goes DOWN: a struct drifting back toward
// `CoSSchedulerSnapshot`'s 97% reds immediately, while the existing backlog
// stays visible and shrinkable. Same shape as #7484's coverage ratchet.
// #8537 tightened seven of these after fixing a scan defect that counted
// PATH-QUALIFIED TYPE POSITIONS as struct literals. ConfigSnapshot's ceiling of
// 15 was 15 miscounts, one for one: the tree contains exactly 15
// `-> crate::ConfigSnapshot {` return types and, measured, every qualified
// occurrence in EXPRESSION position already carried `..Default::default()`. So
// no real literal was lost when the number went to 0 — the ceiling had simply
// been holding room for a miscount, which is the specific way a ratchet decays
// into permission.
