//! The shim's IPv6 extension-header walk, in a module that compiles for the
//! HOST as well as for `bpfel-unknown-none`.
//!
//! #4555: this crate is `no_std` and built for the BPF target, so
//! userspace-dp's tests cannot link it. Four successive parity guards tried to
//! compensate by MODELLING this walk from its source text, and each leaked to a
//! more ordinary edit than the last (substring on the advance arithmetic, a
//! statement outside the `match`, a symbolic `size_of`, a comment hiding a
//! struct field). Replacing the model with three emitted scalars
//! (`MAX_EXT_HDRS`, `size_of::<FragHdr>()`, the class table) closed the
//! tautology but not the coverage: scalars cannot witness BEHAVIOUR, so an
//! altered advance, or a deleted bounds revalidation, left every parity test
//! green.
//!
//! So nothing here is modelled or re-described. Everything the walk needs is in
//! this file, it depends only on `core`, and userspace-dp's parity test pulls
//! THIS FILE in through a module-path attribute and runs it on real byte
//! buffers. Advance arithmetic, bounds revalidation and resolvable chain length
//! stop being claims about source text and become observable outcomes.
//!
//! That attribute is described rather than SPELLED, here and at the `lib.rs`
//! call site, and deliberately: #5173's confinement bound refuses the token
//! pair `[` `path` anywhere under `userspace-xdp/src`, because an attribute
//! that redirects a module pulls source in from outside the directory every
//! one of its other bounds walks. Prose tripping it is a spurious RED, so the
//! prose is worded around it. Do not re-spell it.
//!
//! Nothing in here may take a dependency on `aya`, on a BPF map, or on `std` —
//! that is what keeps it host-compilable, and it is the whole point.
