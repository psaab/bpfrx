# #4800 — new-flow (connection-rate) ceiling harness for the userspace
# dataplane, on the loss userspace cluster.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
# -------------------------------------------------
# This script DRIVES and COLLECTS. It does not derive. Every rate, ratio and
# attribution comes from `newflow_ceiling_analyze.py`, which is fed synthetic
# snapshot pairs by `newflow_ceiling_analyze_test.py` and can therefore be
# trusted to say what it means. Arithmetic embedded in shell is untestable,
# and the whole point of #4800 is a number somebody can defend.
#
# The measurement it produces answers: at a sustained new-flow rate, WHICH of
# the NAT allocator's `live` mutex, `publish_shared_session`, or the N-way
# `replicate_session_upsert` fan-out saturates first? #2852 Phase-2 sharding
# targets only the first, so a run that shows publish and replicate saturating
# earlier is a decision NOT to do that work.
#
# HOW IT CAN FAIL (it must be able to)
# ------------------------------------
# A cell is refused, not scored, when:
#   * the pool-mode SNAT rule was not actually in effect (zero pool
#     allocations over the window — NOT "0 flows/sec");
#   * the helper restarted mid-window (pid change or a backwards counter);
#   * the generator, client NIC or target bound before the firewall did;
#   * traffic landed on too few RX queues, so no cross-worker claim holds;
#   * the pool exhausted its ports (a capacity ceiling, not a lock ceiling).
# The analyzer exits 1 (INVALID) or 2 (INCONCLUSIVE) in those cases and this
# script propagates it. Do not paper over a non-zero exit.
#
# PREREQUISITES (see docs/userspace-newflow-ceiling.md for the full runbook)
#   1. `newflow-gen` built and pushed to the LAN host and the WAN target.
#   2. A pool-mode source-NAT rule on the WAN egress path, committed and
#      confirmed present in `show security nat source pool` before the run.
#   3. The sink running on the WAN target over the destination port range.
#
# USAGE

#       [--rates 5000,10000,20000,40000] [--duration 30] [--threads 32]
#
# Runs under the shared-cluster lock: the loss cluster is not yours alone.
