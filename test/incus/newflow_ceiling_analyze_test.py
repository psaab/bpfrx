"""Tests for the #4800 new-flow-ceiling attribution layer.

Two properties carry the value and are asserted hardest:

1. **The classifier must be able to name MORE THAN ONE culprit.** The
   interesting real-world answer to #4800 is "publish and replicate saturate
   before NAT does". A classifier that reports a single winner would let a
   reader conclude "publish is the bottleneck, shard publish" and miss that
   sharding the NAT allocator alone (#2852 Phase 2) was never going to help.

2. **A quiet run must name NOTHING.** The negative control: a snapshot pair
   where every ratio is below threshold must come back VALID with an empty
   culprit list, not with the least-cold site nominated by default.

The validity gates get their own tests because a harness that cannot fail is
worse than none: a run with no pool allocations, a restarted helper, a
backwards counter, an exhausted pool, an under-driving generator or traffic
landing on one RX queue must each be refused rather than reported as a
number.
