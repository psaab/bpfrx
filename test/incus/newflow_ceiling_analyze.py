"""Turn two helper counter snapshots into a new-flow rate AND an attribution.

This is the analysis half of the #4800 connection-rate harness. The shell
driver (`newflow-ceiling-harness.sh`) only collects; every derivation lives
here so it can be fed synthetic snapshot pairs and asserted, rather than
buried in shell arithmetic that nothing tests.

Why the attribution matters more than the rate
----------------------------------------------
A number that says "new flows/sec plateaued at N" settles nothing. Four
cross-worker synchronization points sit on every transit install:

* the SNAT pool allocator's residual `live` map mutex (#2852 Phase 1),
* `publish_shared_session` (up to three shared-map mutexes per flow),
* the N-way `replicate_session_upsert` fan-out (one sibling queue mutex per
  worker, per flow),
* the event stream's process-global `producer_seq_lock` (#9169), held across
  the frame ENCODE for every session delta -- Open as well as Close. It was
  absent from this model until #9169, so a run bound by it would report a
  plateau with all three other sites cold, which reads as "not lock-bound".
  (Counterfactual: no such run has been performed. The bound is static.)

#2852 Phase-2 sharding targets only the first. If publish and replication
saturate before the allocator does, sharding the allocator alone moves
nothing — which is precisely the conclusion #4800 exists to test. So
`analyze` never reports a single winner: it reports EVERY site over the
saturation threshold, in descending order, plus the full per-site table so a
reader can see the ones that stayed cold.

Why it can report failure
-------------------------
A harness that cannot fail is worse than none. `analyze` returns
`INVALID` when the run did not measure what it claims to (no pool-mode SNAT
allocations at all, a counter that went backwards because the helper
restarted, a non-positive or too-short window) and `INCONCLUSIVE` when
something OTHER than the install path bound first (allocator exhaustion, a
generator that never reached its offered rate, traffic landing on too few RX
queues). Only `VALID` results may be used to argue about the install path,
and even then `saturated=False` with an empty culprit list is a real and
common answer.

No refusal may be disabled by its own input going missing
---------------------------------------------------------
Every gate here is only as trustworthy as the value it reads, and the
recurring bug shape is a MISSING INPUT DEGRADING INTO A VALUE THAT HAPPENS
TO SKIP THE CHECK rather than trip it. Five instances were found and closed
together:

* the sibling queue depth was read as a process-lifetime high-water, so one
  spike in an earlier cell made every later cell report a replication
  backlog — biased toward naming the exact site the #2852 Phase-2 decision
  turns on. Now keyed on a differenceable window MEAN;
* an unparseable generator report reached here as `--offered-rate 0`, which
  left `accept_ratio` at None and skipped the generator-bound check, so a
  broken generator produced a firewall number. Now INVALID;
* a missing `t` defaulted to 0.0, which either killed the window or inflated
  it to ~1.7e9 seconds and yielded a near-zero rate that still read VALID;
* a missing `helper_pid` skipped the restart comparison outright;
* an absent per-worker series left `installs` empty, and the `if installs`
  guards skipped BOTH cross-worker gates — the two that stop a run steered
  onto a single RX queue reading as a cross-worker lock bound.

The last three are refused up front by `REQUIRED_SNAPSHOT_KEYS`. When adding
a gate, add its input there too, and ask what an absent value does: if the
answer is "the gate does not run", the gate fails open.
