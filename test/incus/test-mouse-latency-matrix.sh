# Run the full 12-cell #905 mouse-latency matrix.
#
# Usage: test-mouse-latency-matrix.sh <out_root>
#
# Set MOUSE_COS_SURPLUS_SHARING=1 to run every preflight/rep under
# the diagnostic surplus-sharing fixture instead of the strict exact
# fixture. The per-rep manifest records the selected fixture bit.
#
# Set MOUSE_PROBE_CONNECTION_MODE=persistent for high-concurrency
# 100E100M runs where the validation target is tail latency of
# established mouse transactions rather than echo-server accept rate.
# Set MOUSE_PROBE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS=20 with that mode on the isolated
# validation cluster; it still produces hundreds of thousands of
# samples per 60-second rep without overdriving the selected 620x TCP
# echo daemon.
#
# 12 cells: N ∈ {0, 8, 32, 128} × M ∈ {1, 10, 50}.
# Per cell: run up to 15 total reps as needed to reach 10 valid reps.
# Cell stops at 10 valid reps OR 15 total, whichever is first.
# (Replacements + extensions both draw from the 15-rep ceiling per
# plan §4.7; the >30% conditional was simplified out — we always
# allow up to 15 since the 30% trigger doesn't help if a cell lands
# 1-3 invalid reps and the conditional path was a footgun.)
#
# Cells run in PASS-gate-relevant order so a wall-budget truncation
# degrades gracefully:
#   1. (0, 10)   ← idle baseline of the gate
#   2. (128, 10) ← loaded measurement of the gate
#   then (8, 10), (32, 10), and the rest of the matrix.
#
# Run echo-server preflight first (plan §4.6); abort if it fails.
#
# Total wall budget cap: 6 hours (plan §4.7).
