# #5024 — self-test for the shared cluster-env resolver
# (test/incus/cluster-env.sh).
#
# The HA/failover smoke scripts (test-failover.sh and siblings) read
# ONE set of variables — $FW0, $FW1, $CLUSTER_LAN_HOST — but every
# cluster env file declares its own instance names (VM0/VM1/LAN_HOST)
# and its incus remote (INCUS_REMOTE). cluster-env.sh is the bridge:
# it must
#   (1) source the LAN host from LAN_HOST (NOT a hard-coded
#       cluster-lan-host — the #5024 misdiagnosis), and
#   (2) remote-qualify every instance ref with INCUS_REMOTE, INCLUDING
#       a caller's bare override, so `CLUSTER_LAN_HOST=<name>
#       make test-failover` reaches loss:<name> and not a stray
#       default-remote instance (the #5024 second failure).
#
# This is the RED-on-regression guard for both: reverting the
# LAN_HOST fallback or the always-remote-qualify makes a case below
# fail, naming the broken invariant. It is fully hermetic — no incus,
# no cluster, no network; it only sources cluster-env.sh in a clean
# `env -i` subshell and inspects the resolved variables.
#
# Usage: ./test/incus/cluster-env-selftest.sh   (rc 0 = all pass)
