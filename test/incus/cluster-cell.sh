# #1875 / #4020 — destructive-smoke lock preamble (sourced, never
# executed).
#
# The DESTRUCTIVE HA smoke scripts — test-failover, test-ha-crash,
# test-double-failover, test-stress-failover, test-chained-crash,
# test-active-active, test-restart-connectivity, test-private-rg —
# reboot / force-stop / fail over a node on the SHARED loss userspace
# cluster (loss:xpf-userspace-fw0/fw1). That is FAR more disruptive
# than a deploy, yet historically they took NO cluster lock: a reboot
# could collide with a concurrent agent's deploy or smoke (a deploy
# pushing binaries while a node reboots -> half-deployed node; a
# concurrent test-failover measuring loss while another reboots ->
# garbage results). #4020.
#
# This preamble serializes the destructive smoke under the SAME
# advisory flock on /tmp/xpf-cluster.lock that cluster-setup.sh
# mutating verbs and apply-cos-config.sh already self-lock, so a
# test-failover QUEUES behind (or blocks on) a held lock instead of
# colliding. It never weakens the deploy/apply-cos lock — it is the
# identical re-exec-through-with-cluster.sh mechanism.
#
# Usage — source AFTER `set -euo pipefail`, BEFORE any incus/cluster
# work, passing the script's own path + args:
#
#   set -euo pipefail
#   _CELL_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
#   # shellcheck source=cluster-cell.sh
#   source "${_CELL_DIR}/cluster-cell.sh"

#
# xpf_enter_destructive_cluster_cell <purpose> <script-path> [args...]:
#   1. Re-execs under the incus-admin group if `incus` is not usable,
#      forwarding BPFRX_*/XPF_* explicitly. sg env preservation is not
#      guaranteed on every platform, and losing XPF_CLUSTER_LOCK_HELD
#      across the sg boundary would deadlock a run started inside a
#      with-cluster.sh cell (same reasoning as cluster-setup.sh's sg
#      re-exec — #1875 plan A3 / SMR r2 S1).
#   2. Serializes as a #1875 lock cell: inside a live with-cluster.sh
#      cell (valid marker from a live ancestor holder) it returns
#      immediately and the caller runs lock-free (cells nest); when
#      standalone it re-execs the WHOLE script through with-cluster.sh,
#      which blocks with a named-holder report until the cluster is
#      ours and re-runs the script with the marker set.
#
# The unconditional lock matches the deploy path: cluster-setup.sh's
# init/create/destroy/start/stop/restart take the lock for EVERY
# cluster env (including the legacy local xpf-fw0/1), not just the
# shared loss cluster. /tmp/xpf-cluster.lock is a single dev-box mutex;
# taking it for the rarely-used legacy local cluster is the safe
# direction (serialize, never collide) and needs no shared-vs-local
# detection.
#
# On return the caller holds (transitively) the cluster lock for the
# rest of its run; the kernel releases the flock when the cell's
# process tree exits (with-cluster.sh runs the cell with fd 9 closed).
