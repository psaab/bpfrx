# Self-test for scripts/ignored-cell-census.sh (#8352). Hermetic: fixture trees
# under a mktemp -d and a MOCKED issue-state command. No cluster, no network.
#
# Usage: ./test/incus/ignored-cell-census-selftest.sh   (rc 0 = all pass)
#
# It is a gate ABOUT a gate, so every defence is asserted from BOTH sides: a
# fixture that must FAIL, and the nearly-identical fixture that must PASS. A
# census that reddened on everything would satisfy every failure cell here
# while being useless, and one that reddened on nothing would satisfy every
# pass cell; only having both aimed at the same distinction shows the census
# can tell them apart.
#
# Falsifiability of this file: if the census stops distinguishing a declared
# reason from an undeclared one, the paired cells disagree and the mismatch is
# named. If a fixture stops reaching the census at all, the arrange-side
# assertions (the census's own summary line) fail rather than a cell passing
# vacuously. On an empty fixture the census must FAIL, and that is its own cell.
