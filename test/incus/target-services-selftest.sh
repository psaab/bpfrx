# #8040 — hermetic self-test for test/incus/target-services.sh.
#
# The subject is a diagnosis tool, and a diagnosis tool that reports the wrong
# thing is worse than none: a runner acts on it. The three properties that
# matter, and the failure each one guards:
#
#   1. `check <ports>` exits NON-ZERO when any named port is closed, and ZERO
#      when they are all open. A gate that always passes is the state before
#      #8040 — every harness discovered the missing listener itself, after
#      spending a deploy and the shared cluster lock.
#   2. `check` is SCOPED: a closed port that the caller did not name must not
#      fail it. Requiring all 24 would be an over-rejection that blocks a
#      two-port smoke on an unrelated class, and a gate people learn to skip
#      is a gate that is not there.
#   3. When it DOES fail, it names every missing port — not just the first.
#      Failing on the first hole is exactly the rediscovery loop this replaces:
#      fix one port, re-run, find the next.
#
# Hermetic: `incus` is replaced by a stub on PATH that answers from a scripted
# port table, so nothing here touches a cluster.

# cluster, same instrument and same instant: 0/24 open from either firewall
# node, 23/24 open from the LAN source container. The gate therefore reported

# entirely healthy, and that reading is indistinguishable from the host having
# died. #7100 and #7159 were both parked for weeks on it.
