# #8336 — a reusable crafted-frame screen probe for the shared cluster.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. #8298 was a live security bypass whose cluster reproduction
# was not achievable with the obvious tooling. Two attempts came back VOID, for
# reasons that had nothing to do with the fix and everything to do with the
# instrument. This script is those two attempts turned into a procedure so the
# next screen finding is demonstrable rather than argued.
#
# THE PROCEDURE, and every step is one of the traps:
#
#   1. ARM a screen profile. `stage_screen_check` is gated on
#      `has_screen_state()` and the loss userspace cluster carries no
#      `security screen` config, so without this the whole stage
#      short-circuits and the run is green for reasons unrelated to the change.
#   2. SAMPLE the AGGREGATE `xpf_screen_drops_total`, not the per-reason
#      series. A parse-failure drop is reason `ip-malformed`, which -- with
#      `syn-cookie` and `icmp-fragment` -- appears ONLY in the aggregate. There
#      is no label to sample in the per-reason metric, so a fail-closed drop is
#      invisible there by construction.
#   3. Send a WITNESS frame alongside the subject: something crafted to trip a
#      per-reason screen, whose counter moving proves the path is live. Without
#      it a flat aggregate cannot distinguish "arrived and was permitted" from
#      "never arrived", and that ambiguity is what made both earlier attempts
#      unreadable.
#   4. DISARM, and verify on BOTH nodes. The cluster is shared and config syncs
#      to the peer, so a profile left bound changes the environment for every
#      other lane.
#
# The verdict layer is `screen-probe-lib.sh`, hermetically tested by
# `screen-probe-selftest.sh` (`make test-screen-probe-lib`). The decision --
# in particular that a flat witness is VOID rather than a pass -- lives there
# precisely so it can be tested without a cluster.
#
# USAGE
#   ./test/incus/screen-probe.sh <subject-send-cmd> <witness-send-cmd>
#
# Both commands are run on the LAN host and are expected to emit their frames.
# They are supplied by the caller because the crafted frame IS the experiment;
# this script owns the arming, sampling, witnessing and cleanup around it.
#
# This script takes the shared-cluster lock via cluster-cell.sh, like every
# other destructive or config-mutating target. NEVER run it outside the lock:
# it commits config to both nodes.

# arm commits the screen profile and VERIFIES the commit from the CLI

#
# #6440: the piped-stdin CLI is a REPL. It prints "error: ..." for a failed
# command and still exits 0, so `if ! incus exec ... <<EOF` cannot fire. The
# first version of this script gated on the exit status, which meant a failed
# arm set `armed_state="armed"` and the probe then measured an UNARMED box
# while reporting a verdict — trap 1 wearing this script's own clothes, since
# trap 1 is precisely "the screen stage short-circuits and the run is green for
# reasons unrelated to the change".
#
# Caught by `TestEveryConfigCommittingSmokeUsesTheMarkerGate_6936`, which scans
# every config-committing smoke script for this gate. The guard lives in
# cmd/cli and the script is shell, which is exactly why it was missed: a guard
# can live in a package the change never touched.
