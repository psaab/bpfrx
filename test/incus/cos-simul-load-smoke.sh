# #1614 simul-load smoke harness — run all 11 CoS classes in parallel for
# 30 s, then reduce per-class achievement / CoV / retrans against the v5
# acceptance criteria (plan.md §7 gates 1, 2, 3, 8), as re-scoped by
# #1691 / #1614 §3.A: under full-11 simul the ~22-24 G C_phys push
# ceiling divides among the backlogged classes, so push gate 1 is a
# DIVIDED-CEILING REGRESSION FLOOR, not the >=95% guarantee (which is
# SOLO-only via #1630 cos-gate1-small-four-alone.sh). See
# docs/fairness-regimes.md "Aggregate push ceiling C_phys".
#
# Usage:
#   ./test/incus/cos-simul-load-smoke.sh [push|reverse]   # default push
#
# Expects the loss userspace cluster to be deployed and the
# cos-iperf-config.set fixture applied:
#   sg incus-admin -c "./test/incus/cluster-setup.sh deploy all"
#   sg incus-admin -c "./test/incus/apply-cos-config.sh loss:xpf-userspace-fw0"
#
# Direction default is push (the regression direction). Pass "reverse"
# explicitly to run the Phase 0 / R8 sanity check that determines whether
# the firewall or the generator is the bottleneck. See plan.md §7 gate 8.
