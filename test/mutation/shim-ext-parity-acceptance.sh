# #4555 acceptance harness: prove the IPv6 extension-header parity guards
# actually fire, by mutating the shim's walk and observing the guards red.
#
# Committed deliberately. The mutation rows in the PR body and _Log.md are only
# evidence if the procedure that produced them can be audited — ordering, return
# codes, restore verification and signal handling all change what the rows mean.
# Prose describing a harness is not a harness.
#
# EVERY CHECK MUST BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE THING IT REPORTS ON.
#
# Review found the same defect three times in this one file: a probe that
# reports success without having observed anything. The build gate ran
# `cargo build`, which never compiles the file being mutated, so a mutation
# that did not even parse scored as "the guard fired". The row's per-test
# columns were decorative — deleting BOTH negative-control tests left every row
# printing an empty column and the script still exited PASS, because
# `cargo test <filter matching nothing>` exits 0 with `0 passed` and no
# Go-style `[no tests to run]` marker. And the "first divergence" extractor's
# character class excluded `{` and `:`, so once the assertion text changed it
# matched nothing and every RED row printed no reason at all.
#
# So each check below closes its own path to vacuous success, and the two that
# were previously inoperative are DEMONSTRATED by preflights rather than
# asserted:
#
#   P1  a deliberate syntax error in the mutated file must make the BUILD gate
#       fail. If it does not, the build gate does not compile that file and no
#       row it prints can distinguish an assertion from a compile error.
#   P2  a filter matching nothing must be REPORTED AS MISSING by the same
#       per-test extractor the rows use — not scored as a pass.
#
# Four properties, each learned from a failure of an earlier version:
#
#   1. EXCLUSIVE LOCK, at a fixed path. Two concurrent runs mutate the same file
#      and interleave their restores; one run's row then describes the other
#      run's tree. The lock used to live under ${TMPDIR}, which this repo
#      routinely varies, so two runs took two different locks and serialised
#      nothing.
#   2. GREEN BASELINE SELF-CHECK (row 0), plus a VERIFIED-BEFORE-CAPTURED
#      baseline. If the tree is not clean before the first mutation, every later
#      row is void. An earlier run was killed mid-mutation, the next run
#      captured the mutated tree as its "pristine" copy, and reported a clean
#      tree as failing. Passing tests are NOT tree cleanliness: a mutation the
#      guards do not detect would be captured as GOLD and restored as
#      "pristine", so the file is compared against git as well — BEFORE the
#      capture, and refusing to run at all when git cannot answer.
#
#      Scope, precisely, because an earlier revision of this comment said
#      "a tree-cleanliness check" and meant something narrower: exactly ONE
#      path is compared against git, ${WALK_REL}, because that is the file this
#      script OVERWRITES and restores. The guard tests and the negative
#      controls are NOT compared against git; they are covered BEHAVIOURALLY
#      instead — row 0 requires them green on the unmutated tree (so a locally
#      broken or unconditionally-red guard aborts the run) and the NEG-CTL row
#      requires them to SURVIVE a semantically null edit (so a guard rewritten
#      to red on any change fails too). Neither of those is a claim that the
#      working tree matches HEAD.
#   3. RESTORE ON EXIT/INT/TERM, VERIFIED. A trap cannot catch SIGKILL, so the
#      trap is not the safety property — property 2 is. The trap narrows the
#      window; the `cmp` is what proves the restore happened.
#   4. EVERY ROW CARRIES AN EXPECTATION. A row that must RED and a row that must
#      SURVIVE are both checked, so a harness that reds unconditionally fails
#      just as loudly as one that never reds. The NEG-CTL row is a semantically
#      null edit to the mutated file: it must survive, which is what separates
#      "the guard binds this BEHAVIOUR" from "the guard noticed the file
#      changed". Rows are named, not numbered, in this prose — inserting a
#      mutation renumbers every row after it, and a comment citing a stale
#      number is the same defect in miniature as a check citing prose.
#   5. ONE MUTATION PER ROW, and one arm per row where an edit could be
#      applied to several. A row that mutates two arms at once scores RED on
#      either one reding, so it cannot support a claim about both.
#
# Usage:  test/mutation/shim-ext-parity-acceptance.sh
# Requires: cargo + the pinned toolchain, python3; no root, no cluster, no
# network.
# Runtime: ~5 min per row, and there are 18 rows plus two preflights — the
# mutated file is `#[path]`-included into the userspace-dp test binary, so
# every row is a full release rebuild of that crate. Budget an hour and a half.

# --- preconditions: the baseline is VERIFIED BEFORE IT IS CAPTURED -----------
#
# ORDER IS THE PROPERTY, and it used to be wrong. An earlier revision captured
# GOLD at the top of the script and consulted git 138 lines later, so on any
# tree git could not speak for, the capture had already happened: the script
# printed "UNVERIFIED", accepted whatever bytes were on disk as the pristine
# copy, ran every row against them, and "restored" that state at the
# end. Measured by replaying the real capture-then-precondition sequence
# against an archive with no `.git`: it printed UNVERIFIED and continued with a
# `(len+1)*8 -> (len+1)*16` mutation installed as GOLD.
#
# So a baseline that CANNOT be verified now ABORTS. "We could not check" is not
# "it is fine": this file exists because a probe that reports success without
# having observed anything is the defect that keeps regrowing in it, and a
# harness cannot make an exception of itself.

       captured as GOLD and restored as 'pristine' at the end. Run this from a checkout."

# `diff --quiet HEAD --`, NOT `diff --quiet --`. The latter compares the
# worktree against the INDEX, so a STAGED mutation is "no difference" and sails
# through a check whose own abort text spells out the consequence: the mutation

# result it did not establish. Measured: `git update-index --assume-unchanged`
# flipped `diff --quiet HEAD` from rc 1 to rc 0 with the `* 16` mutation still
# in the file, and the precondition then reported "matches git HEAD (index

# the corpus gained its exhaustive dimension sweeps (floor 7): the generic arm
# sampled 5 declared lengths of 256, AUTH 3 of 256, the Fragment `reserved`
# byte 1 of 256, and every chain in the corpus declared TCP as its terminal so
# the byte an extension header CARRIES took 4 values of 256.
#
# All four change real packet classification, so a row that stops reding here
# means the sweep it depends on has been narrowed, not that the mutation became
