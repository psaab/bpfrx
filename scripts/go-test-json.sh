# go-test-json.sh — run a `go test` leg, optionally teeing a machine-readable
# `go test -json` stream to a side file while leaving stdout byte-identical.
#
# #8231. The mutation driver gates through `make test-go` / `make test-rust`
# because those targets carry legs a bare `go test` does not — `go vet`, the
# targeted `-race` runs with `-count=2`, and on the Rust side `--release` and
# `--test-threads=1`. So its KILLED verdicts are COUNT-based: they say
# *something* failed, not that the cell's target failed. If another test in the
# package was already red, a cell that changed nothing scores KILLED with rc and
# count in agreement and nothing looking wrong. That is a false claim of
# coverage, and only a NAME can refute it.
#
# The wrong repair is to convert the driver to `go test -json`, which would buy
# attribution and pay for it in gate coverage. This is the right one: the GATE
# TARGET emits the machine-readable stream alongside its normal output, so
# attribution costs nothing.
#
# usage: go-test-json.sh <jsonfile-or-empty> <go> [go test args...]
#
# With an EMPTY first argument this execs `<go> test <args>` unchanged — no
# `-json`, no `jq`, no pipeline. That is deliberate: `make test-go` is the shared
# gate and its default path must not acquire a jq dependency or a new failure
# mode. The selftest asserts the default path's stdout and exit code are
# identical to a direct `go test`.
#
# With a jsonfile it runs `<go> test -json <args>`, APPENDS the raw event stream
# to that file, and reconstructs the human-readable stream on stdout from the
# `.Output` fields. That reconstruction is exact: `go test -json` carries every
# byte the text formatter would have written, in order, in `.Output`.
