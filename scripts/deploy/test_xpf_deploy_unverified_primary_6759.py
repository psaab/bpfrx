"""#6759: detect a recreated node that is PRIMARY before its identity is proven.

The image-roll drains the node, then RECREATES it — a fresh disk. That wipes
the drain, because the drain lived on the disk that was replaced. The identity
gate (live xpf-version == the AUTHENTICATED manifest's, and /etc/xpf/node-id ==
the assigned cluster node-id, #5075) runs AFTERWARDS in the boot poll. Between
bringup and gate-pass the node is un-drained with unvalidated identity.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not close the window. The election happens during
the recreated node's own bringup — `daemon_run_bringup.go` runs `UpdateConfig`,
which elects on the single-node path — before any driver command reaches the
node. This DETECTS the exposure and stops the roll; it cannot prevent it.

Why the kernel-roll's fix cannot be reused: `holdSecondaryIfKernelCandidateArmed`
keys the election hold on the on-node kernel journal, and
`kernel_selfrecover.go` folds a clean ENOENT to "never armed" with no hold. A
reboot preserves that journal so ENOENT genuinely means "never armed"; a
recreate DESTROYS it, so ENOENT means "the evidence was wiped" — and nothing on
the node can tell those apart. The distinction is correct for the path it was
written for and has no way to be right for this one.
