"""Two concurrent fetches must not leave the watermark ahead of the image (#9238).

`cmd_fetch` consults the anti-rollback watermark TWICE with the same comparison
and opposite consequences. The early check (before the download) calls `die`.
The late check (after verification) used the comparison only as the condition
for *writing* the watermark — when it failed, nothing happened at all: no die,
no warning, execution falling straight through to the incus alias import and
the libvirt golden replacement.

That late block re-reads `prev`, so it is the one place in the process holding
correct information about a concurrent advance, and it discarded it:

    start                                      wm=v0   alias=v0
    A verifies v1, passes the early check, stalls
    B verifies v2, advances, publishes         wm=v2   alias=v2
    A resumes, re-reads prev=v2, skips write,
      and PUBLISHES ANYWAY                     wm=v2   alias=v1  <-- inverted

Deploy checks only that the alias/golden EXISTS, so v1 is then consumed as the
channel's stable identity with nothing dissenting. No forged signature and no
--allow-rollback is involved: both images are legitimately signed, and the
ordering does all the work.

The concurrency is modelled by advancing the watermark from inside
`verify_image_artifact` — that is exactly the window the interleaving needs
(after the early check, before the late one), and it makes the race
deterministic instead of hoping two real processes interleave.

Two halves are pinned separately, because neither alone is sufficient:

  1. the late comparison ABORTS instead of falling through, and
  2. the read/compare/publish run under ONE lock, so a second fetch cannot slip
     between the check and the alias import. Without the lock, half 1 only
     narrows the window.

Hermetic: a throwaway minisign keypair, a `file://` base URL, a private
XDG_STATE_HOME, and `incus` stubbed out. No network, no incus, no root.
