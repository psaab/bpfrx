"""#6762: lease renewal must continue DURING the recreate hook.

`_fence_before_mutate` extends both leases to one fresh TTL and returns. The
recreate hook that follows is an ARBITRARY operator script doing
destroy+launch+day-0 — an image pull, a cloud API wait, a bare-metal re-flash —
with no bound on its duration, and while it ran NOTHING renewed.

A hook outliving the TTL let the still-up peer's lease expire, and that peer
lease is the SOLE remaining reservation once the recreate wipes the node's own
/var/lib. A successor could then acquire BOTH node leases and begin a concurrent
roll on a pair this driver was mid-recreate on — the split-brain deploy the
whole lease mechanism exists to prevent.

The fence's own comment names the risk (#5545 flagged the recreate as
"potentially outlasting a short TTL"); a single extension answers "the phase
boundary", not "the phase".
