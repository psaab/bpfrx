"""Hermetic unit tests for the #7347 skip ledger.

`scripts/image/validate.py` is the gate `bake.py`'s `finalize_artifacts` runs
STRICTLY BEFORE `sign_step` (#4017). Scenario Q returned early when `qemu-img`
was absent, `main()` ran the scenarios for effect and returned 0 regardless,
and `bake.py` reads exit 0 as a pass — so on a host without qemu-utils the
whole structural probe was skipped and the artifact was still minisigned
`validated: true`.

**A scenario that returns is indistinguishable from one that asserted**, and
here the difference was laundered through a signature: `publish.py` and
`xpf-deploy.py fetch` verify the signature and read a signed image as a
validated one. That is why this is worse than a gate that fails open into a log
line — downstream has no way to tell.

This is the SECOND vacuous gate found in the signing path. #6547 was the first
(the seal was never asserted), fixed in #7317, which set the posture this
follows: *"a security gate that skips itself when its tool is absent is the
vacuous-gate shape this check exists to remove."*

Two things these tests are careful about:

  * THE GATE IS CALIBRATED ON KNOWN-BAD INPUT BEFORE ANY GREEN IS TRUSTED.
    `test_missing_qemu_img_fails` strips qemu-img from PATH and asserts the
    scenario EXITS rather than returning — proving the gate fails when the tool
    is absent, not merely that it passes when present. A gate that has only
    ever been observed passing has not been observed at all.

  * FATAL vs TOLERATED IS A MEASURED CLASSIFICATION, NOT A GUESS. It is decided
    by one question: does bake.py guarantee the tool on a real bake host?
    `test_fatal_classification_matches_bake_requirements` reads bake.py's own
    preflight and pins the answer, so the classification cannot drift away from
    the thing that justifies it.
