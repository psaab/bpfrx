"""Regression test for the #1930 kernel-hold enumeration in bake.py.

The bake pins the kernel package set with `apt-mark hold` so a background
apt cannot drift the kernel out from under the verifier-gated AF_XDP shim
(#1864/#1930). The package set is enumerated in-guest with:

    pkgs=$(dpkg-query -W -f="${Package}\\n" "linux-image-*" ... | sort -u)

That fragment is handed to the guest's `sh -c`, so the `$` in `${Package}`
must reach dpkg-query LITERALLY. Unescaped, the guest shell expands
`${Package}` itself — it is an unset shell variable, so the format string
collapses to a bare `\\n`, dpkg-query emits one blank line per installed
kernel package, `$(...)` strips the trailing newlines, and `pkgs` comes out
EMPTY. The bake then dies at its own guard:

    FATAL: no linux-* packages found to hold

which aborts every bake before the image is ever written. (Introduced
2026-06-16 by 6948ed0f8, #1930 INC-0; found by running a real bake.)

This test extracts the actual `--run-command` string bake.py emits and runs
it under a real /bin/sh against a STUB dpkg-query + apt-mark, asserting the
kernel packages are enumerated and held.

RED on revert: drop the backslash before `${Package}` in bake.py and
test_enumerates_kernel_packages fails with the FATAL guard message.
