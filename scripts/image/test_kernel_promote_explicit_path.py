"""Self-test: the #1930 kernel promotion gate runs the xpfd the ARMING recorded.

#6541 / #6601. `scripts/image/xpf-kernel-promote` is the OUTER hop of the A/B
kernel promote/rollback gate: systemd runs it as root on every boot, and on a
candidate boot the exit status of the `xpfd upgrade kernel promote` it invokes
decides promote-vs-rollback. A bare, $PATH-resolved `xpfd` lets any PATH entry
ordered ahead of the real location author that decision — or, with no attacker
at all, lets a stale xpfd from some other directory verify the wrong build
against the candidate kernel.

Six revisions tried to answer "which xpfd is live?" from ambient state — $PATH,
compiled defaults, inode identity, a unit name, then that unit's LoadState — and
each one closed a single stale-authority window and left another. The last broke
concretely: a DISABLED unit still reports LoadState=loaded with MainPID=0, so a
leftover default unit whose drop-in named an OLD version satisfied the arm-time
check and its stale ExecStart was accepted on the candidate boot.

r6 stopped selecting signals. `xpfd upgrade kernel arm` IS an xpfd, so
os.Executable() names the live binary by construction; arming RECORDS that path
and the boot gate READS it. The question changes from "which xpfd is live?"
(unanswerable later) to "which xpfd armed this candidate?" (a fact). So the gate
now has:

    * ONE authority — the arm record;
    * a CROSS-CHECK against the pinned unit (MainPID -> /proc/<pid>/exe, then a
      strictly-parsed ExecStart) which may CONTRADICT the record but never
      replace it;
    * a LOUD refusal on contradiction or on an unusable record;
    * a quiet "nothing to promote" ONLY when the record is absent AND the
      journal agrees nothing is armed (#6601 r7).

Two consequences shape the tests below.

FIRST, the unit hops are still live code, but a wrong answer from them costs
something different now: it no longer hands an impostor the promote decision, it
manufactures a false DISAGREEMENT and REFUSES a healthy promotion. So the
recycled-pid / cgroup / ExecStart-parsing tests assert that the gate still runs
THE RECORDED BINARY — a mutation that loosens one of those guards turns the run
into a refusal and reds the test.

SECOND, the quiet skip is itself an inference, and this issue exists because
every inference eventually met a box that broke it. "Record absent" means
"nothing armed" only because arming writes the record, and losing just ONE of
the two files breaks that: a `/var/lib/xpf` restored from before the arm or
restored partially, a stray cleanup that takes the sidecar and leaves the
journal, or a candidate armed by a build predating the sidecar. A candidate then
goes UNVERIFIED behind a log line that reads like an ordinary boot — the same
laundering the r5 MINOR-1 work removed from the not-found-unit branch — so the
journal is consulted for ONE BIT (is a candidate ARMED) and the divergent state
is loud.

(A non-default `--journal` is NOT one of those cases and must not be cited as
one: Go derives the sidecar from the journal's directory, so that flag moves
BOTH files together and the gate finds neither. It is a real trap — the boot
unit hardcodes this script with no way to pass a journal path, so such a
candidate is structurally unpromotable — but a separate one, closed at the ARM
end by #6631 rather than here.)

FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore `command -v xpfd` / bare `xpfd upgrade kernel promote`,
reintroduce a compiled-default fallback, remove the arm-record check, or make
ARMED-without-record silent again, and this file fails.

class TestArmedWithoutARecordIsNotLaundered(_GateBase):
    """#6601 r7 — "record absent" is an INFERENCE, and it must be checked.

    The r5 work removed a benign-looking skip from the not-found-unit branch
    because an ARMED candidate could go unverified behind it. The r6 redesign
    then introduced a new branch with exactly that shape: the record is absent,
    so the gate declares "nothing to promote" and exits — a positive claim made
    from the ABSENCE of a file.

    That claim holds only because arming writes the record (before the ARMED
    transition) and clears it with the journal, so no crash ordering can produce
    the divergence. Losing ONE of the two files out of band can:

      * a /var/lib/xpf restored from a backup taken before the arm, or restored
        only partially;
      * a stray cleanup (tmpfiles rule, an operator `rm`, a housekeeping sweep)
        that removes the sidecar and leaves the journal;
      * a candidate armed by a build PREDATING the sidecar and upgraded through
        the #1917 binary channel before the candidate boot — journal ARMED, no
        record ever written.

    A candidate is then armed, the gate silently does not run, and the next
    reboot reverts it.

    Explicitly NOT one of those: `arm --journal <elsewhere>`. Go derives the
    sidecar from the journal's directory, so that flag moves both files together
    and the gate finds neither, taking the quiet branch. It is a separate trap
    (the boot unit hardcodes the script with no journal argument, so such a
    candidate can never be promoted at all), closed at the ARM end by #6631 —
    `KernelRunner.Arm` refuses a non-default journal path — and it must not be
    cited as this check's motivation.

    Not promoting is the SAFE direction, so this is availability and honesty
    rather than security — but a candidate kernel that silently never promotes
    is exactly the laundering the tests above exist to prevent. So the quiet
    exit is conditional on the journal agreeing, and the divergent state is loud.
