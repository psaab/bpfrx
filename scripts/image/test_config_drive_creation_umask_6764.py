"""The day-0 ISO must never EXIST world-readable, not merely end up 0600 (#6764).

The ISO tools create the output file themselves, so its mode comes from the
process umask at CREATION time — a typical 0022 yields 0644. The chmod that
follows the build only narrows it afterwards, and the file already contains
xpf.conf from the moment the tool writes it. On a large image that window is the
whole build, and every co-located UID can `isoinfo -R -x /xpf.conf` the
root-authentication hash, the IKE pre-shared key, the SNMP community and the
DDNS tokens straight out of it.

The pre-existing #4905-C test cannot see this. Its fake explicitly does
`os.chmod(out, 0o644)` AFTER writing — it simulates the finished artifact and
asserts the post-build chmod narrows it. That passes whether or not the file was
ever reachable at 0644 during construction, which is the thing that matters.

This test observes the mode the file has AT THE MOMENT THE TOOL CREATES IT,
under a deliberately lax 0022 umask, and never chmods it in the fake. With the
umask guard removed the recorded mode is 0644 and this fails; the post-build
chmod cannot repair a window that has already closed.
