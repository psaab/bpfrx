"""Hermetic unit tests for `guest_absent` (#7424 row 2).

The four negative assertions in scenarios A and C -- "the factory boot
installed no config" and "the REJECT wrote nothing" -- were written as

    if guest(inst, <existence probe>, check=False).returncode == 0:
        fail(...)

which fails OPEN. (Written without the literal tokens so the census below can
stay a clean zero-occurrence check rather than whitelisting its own docs.) `incus exec` exits non-zero both when the in-guest `test -e`
finds nothing AND when incus could not run the command at all (instance not
running, agent not up, connection refused). Only `== 0` was tested, so a
transport failure was indistinguishable from absence and scored as PASS.

The middle row of the table below is the one that matters and the one no
previous test could express: a check that could not observe its property must
not report that the property holds. Testing only PRESENT and ABSENT would leave
the fail-open exactly as it was, because the old code got both of those right.

RED on revert: restoring the `returncode == 0` form makes
`test_transport_failure_is_not_absence` pass silently (the helper would return
True), so that cell is the fail-on-revert pin.
