# Self-test for scripts/image/xpf-grow-root (#1925).
#
# Runs the REAL wrapper with PATH shadowed by mock findmnt/lsblk/growpart/
# resize2fs, XPF_GROW_ROOT_SYSFS pointed at a synthetic sysfs tree, and
# XPF_GROW_ROOT_STAMP pointed at a temp file, then asserts:
#   1. device resolution — the right (disk, partition) pair + the exact
#      growpart/resize2fs argv across sda/vda/nvme bus naming;
#   2. STAMP discipline — the stamp is written ONLY on genuine success
#      (NOCHANGE / grew+resize2fs-ok) and left ABSENT on every failure
#      (growpart real failure, growpart-grew-but-resize2fs-failed partial,
#      unresolved root) so the unit's ConditionPathExists re-fires and the
#      grow retries; AND the wrapper ALWAYS exits 0 (boot never blocked);
#   3. retry convergence — a resize2fs-fail (no stamp) followed by a second
#      run with growpart->NOCHANGE + resize2fs->ok writes the stamp.
#
# Non-tautological by construction: the mock growpart/resize2fs record
# EXACTLY the args the wrapper passed; the assertions pin those bytes, and
# the stamp checks read the real file the wrapper writes. The
# resize2fs-fails / growpart-fails cases MUST FAIL against any build that
# stamps unconditionally (e.g. an ExecStartPost touch, or the pre-fix head
# 8fccd325) — they pin the exact regression Codex flagged. A negative
# control proves the harness can fail.
#
# Pure user-space: no root, no real block devices, no kernel. Runs in CI /
# the engineering quad's gate alongside bash -n + shellcheck.
