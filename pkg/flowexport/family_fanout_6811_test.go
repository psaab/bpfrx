// #6811: a sampling instance carrying BOTH families cross-fanned each family's
// flows to the other family's collectors.
//
// The families are separate in config (`SamplingInstance.FamilyInet` /
// `FamilyInet6`, each with its own FlowServers), but
// collectInstanceVersionCollectors merged them into ONE collector slice and
// collapsed family to two per-INSTANCE booleans. `CollectorConfig` had no family
// field, grouping keyed on template alone, and `ServesFamily` was evaluated per
// instance — so with both families configured both booleans were true, the gate
// passed for either family, and the daemon fanned the record to EVERY group of
// that instance.
//
// Result: `family inet { flow-server A }` + `family inet6 { flow-server B }`
// sent IPv4 flows to BOTH A and B.
//
// Why it went unnoticed is worth recording: the strict validator explicitly
// PERMITS one instance holding both families, and the existing isolation tests
// (#2462) use family-DISJOINT instances while the template tests use a single
// family. No test configured the shape that breaks. These cells do.

// bothFamiliesInstance builds the shape the defect needs: one instance, one
// flow-server per family, distinct addresses so a cross-fan is visible.
