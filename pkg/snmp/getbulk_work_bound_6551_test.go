// #6551: GETBULK used to materialize the whole repeaters x max-repetitions grid
// BEFORE the RFC 3416 §4.2.3 response-size bound was applied. repeaterCount is
// len(oids)-nonRepeaters and is bounded only by how many varbinds a manager can
// pack into one request datagram, and every grid cell costs a findNextOIDSnap
// MIB walk plus a getOIDValueSnap.
//
// Measured on the pre-fix code with 50 interfaces, a 4094-byte v2c GETBULK
// carrying 580 minimal repeater OIDs and max-repetitions >= 100:
//
//	varbinds BUILT   58,000   (405 ms inside buildBulkVarbinds)
//	varbinds RETURNED   116   (4092-byte response)
//	end-to-end handlePacket   667 ms   vs a ~2.5 us single-varbind poll
//
// (the trim itself accounts for the remaining ~260 ms: trimToFit binary-searches
// ~log2(58000) = 16 full re-encodes of the 58,000-varbind list). ~1.5 requests
// per second saturate the single serial SNMP goroutine permanently.
//
// Post-fix the same request builds 118 varbinds in 48 us and answers in 1.0 ms,
// returning the identical 116 varbinds.
//
// These tests assert on varbinds BUILT, not returned: the returned count was
// always ~116, so a test that only checked the response would pass on the
// unfixed code.

// minVarbindEncodedBytes is a lower bound on the bytes any varbind can occupy
// in an encoded varbind list: a SEQUENCE header (tag + 1 length byte, a minimal
// body being far below 128) wrapping an OID TLV and a value TLV, each at least
// a bare tag + length byte. 2+2+2.
//
// It is used for one thing only — capping how many cells a build that stops at
// the response ceiling could possibly have produced — and for that a valid
// floor is all that is required. The floor is attained only by the degenerate
// shape berEncodeOID emits a nil body for (an OID with fewer than two
// components), which TestVarbindEncodedLenMatchesEncoder_6551 exercises as
// "short-oid-no-body". buildBulkVarbinds cannot produce one from a real
// request: its OIDs are either walked out of the MIB or echoed from the
// request, and berDecodeOID rejects an empty body while turning any non-empty
// one into at least two components, so every varbind reachable from the wire
// re-encodes to at least 7 bytes. A floor of 6 therefore makes the cap
// CONSERVATIVE, never unsound. TestWireVarbindByteFloors_6551 pins both halves
// of that.
//
// The cap bounds the CELL COUNT of the build. It says nothing about whether the
// response fits: real returned varbinds carry full OIDs and values and are far
// larger than any floor. Fitting is trimToFit's job, and the equality oracle
// TestGetBulkBoundedMatchesUnbounded_6551 is what proves the stop does not

//     sound — but it is a conservative one, not the reachable minimum.
//
//  2. REQUEST side: decodePDUFields does NOT require a varbind to carry a value
//     TLV, so the densest packing it accepts is a 5-byte varbind, not the
//     7-byte well-formed one. Any bound on how many OIDs a single datagram can
