//
// A BYTE SCAN IS UNSOUND HERE AND I SHIPPED ONE FIRST. tagIPAddress is 0x40,
// and the SNMPv2c PDU carries a RANDOMIZED request-id, so roughly one build in
// three contained a 0x40 byte inside an integer and my "is there an IpAddress
// TLV" check reported one that did not exist. The cell passed alone and failed
// about one full-package run in three — a flaky red, which is worse than no
// cell, because it teaches everyone to re-run.
//
// The same unsoundness was in the v1 decoder: it took the first 0x40 byte in
// the packet, which the TimeTicks value or an OID can supply.
//
// Definite-length BER, short and long form. The long form is required, not
// optional: the v2c message is 132 bytes and its outer SEQUENCE is encoded
// `30 81 81`. A first version of this walker refused the long form rather than
// guessing at it, which is why that showed up as a clear message instead of a
// misparse — a decoder that guesses a length is how a byte scan's unsoundness
// comes back wearing a parser's clothes.

// builds, and that is unsound for the same reason the byte-identity check
// documented above it was unsound — one level down and with a much lower hit
// rate, which is why it survived review and then reddened `go test ./...` for
// every lane at a measured 1.08% over 20,000 iterations.
