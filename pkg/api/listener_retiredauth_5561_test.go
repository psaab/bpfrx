// listener_retiredauth_5561_test.go is the fail-on-revert gate for the #5561
// round-14 MAJOR-2 property: a credential the committed config authorized for a
// NEW management address must never become valid on the address that same commit
// RETIRED.
//
// Retirement is asynchronous. stopLegLocked only closes a channel; the leg's
// serve goroutine wakes up later, and only then does Shutdown close the socket
// and drain. ReconcileHTTP/ReconcileHTTPS return as soon as that channel is
// closed, and the management reconciler then publishes the committed credential
// set. So there is a real interval — bounded by scheduling for new connections
// and by the 5s graceful drain for accepted ones — in which the retired listener
// is still answering requests. While every leg read one shared snapshot, the
// grant went out on that listener too.
//
// The fix is a per-leg snapshot pinned at retirement (authSlot), which can only
// tighten afterwards. These cases drive the leg handlers directly rather than
// over TCP: the property is which POLICY a leg enforces, and going through a
// real socket would make the assertion depend on winning a scheduling race
// against the drain, which is the opposite of a deterministic guard.

// legProbe runs a Basic-auth request against a leg's handler and reports whether
// it was admitted.
