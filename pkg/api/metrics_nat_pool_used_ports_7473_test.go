// natPoolUsedPortsSamples collects the pool names that emitted an

//
// It records PRESENCE, not value, because the value cannot distinguish the two
// states: a pool the dataplane never installed reads 0, and 0 is also the
// honest reading for a healthy idle pool. The defect is that the SERIES EXISTS.
// An assertion on the number would be the vacuous version of this test — it
// would pass before and after the fix.

// #8606: the source is now the helper's live status rather than the legacy
// `nat_port_counters` map. The fixture below reports BOTH pools in that status
// on purpose: supplying only the healthy one would make the refused-pool
// assertion pass because the pool is ABSENT from the status, not because the
// refusal gate suppressed it — the discriminator this test exists for.

// #7473: a pool the snapshot builder REFUSED must emit no
// `xpf_nat_pool_used_ports` sample.
//
// #7000 made the capacity gauge honest — `xpf_nat_pool_total_ports` is 0 for a
// refused pool, computed through `SourceNATPoolReportablePorts`. The USAGE
// gauge in the same loop was not gated at all, and it could not be caught by
// noticing a wrong number: `cr.PoolIDs` contains refused pools, because
// `compiler_nat.go` assigns ids without consulting any disarm predicate, so the
// lookup succeeds and `ReadNATPortCounter` returns 0.
//
// A published `used=0` says "measured, and nothing is used". An absent series
// says "not installed". Monitoring cannot tell the first from health — which is
// exactly the argument the #5046 comment in this same function already makes
// for omitting the sample on a counter-READ failure. The refused-pool case
// reaches the same fake zero by a different route.
//
// This surface is the one that must be exactly right: unlike its two CLI twins
// (`show security nat source pool`, and the summary row), a scrape has no
// adjacent NOT INSTALLED line to contradict the number.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: drop the `&& unusable == ""` from the `cr.PoolIDs` lookup in
// `collectNATPoolMetrics` and the `bad` leg reds.
