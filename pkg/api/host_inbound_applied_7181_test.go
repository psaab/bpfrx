// #7181: the tri-state must not collapse.
//
// WHY A TABLE AND NOT TWO CELLS. `Established` is sticky-true: a failed render
// does NOT clear it, because the retained generation may still be protecting.
// So the two ends — never-established and established-and-healthy — are passed
// by a renderer that simply returns `Established`. Only the MIDDLE row
// (Established AND LastApplyFailed) separates a correct implementation from
// that one, and it is the row an operator most needs, because it is the box
// whose latest render failed while a stale table still stands.
