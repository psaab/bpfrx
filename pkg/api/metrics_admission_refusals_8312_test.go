// series was never emitted, or emitted from a different limiter, or emitted
// with a constant — which is the shape that leaves an instrument present and

// TestAdmissionRefusalsMetricTracksTheRealLimiter8312 is the wiring bind: a

// The other-labels assertion is the half that matters. A collector that emitted
// one limiter's count under every label, or hardcoded a value, satisfies "the
// session_walk series moved" — only the cross-label comparison separates them.
//
// MUTATION: emit `float64(diagcmd.SessionWalkLimiter.Refusals())` for every
// label instead of `l.limiter.Refusals()` -> the remote_walk assertion reds.
// Drop the `emitAdmissionRefusals` call from Collect -> the descriptor-coverage
// canary stays green (Describe/Collect are consistent either way) and only this
// cell notices, which is why it drives the emitter rather than a scrape.
