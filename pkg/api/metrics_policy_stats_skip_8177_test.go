// collectPolicyCounters does `if !statsEnabled && !rule.Count { continue }` —
// it SKIPS the series rather than emitting a zero. That is the right answer for
// a time series and the opposite of what the other six surfaces needed: an
// absent sample is not a zero sample, and a zero here would be indistinguishable
// from a policy that genuinely matched no traffic, forever, in every dashboard
// and alert built on it.
//
// The risk this guards is a future audit "fixing" the inconsistency the wrong
// way — seeing five surfaces that now report the stats-disabled state and
// making this one report it too, by emitting a 0 with a flag. #8177 deliberately
// did not touch this function; a red here means someone turned a skip into a
// sample.
