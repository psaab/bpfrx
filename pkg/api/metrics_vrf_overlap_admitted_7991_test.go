// vrfOverlapStore builds a store whose ACTIVE config a tolerant load accepts but
// the strict commit gate would REJECT (#7924): two routing-instances carrying
// overlapping L3, plus a PBR `then routing-instance` term.
//
// Seeded via a persisted DB + tolerant Load() rather than Commit(), because
// Commit runs the strict path and refuses it. That is the whole point — this
// models a config persisted before #7927 and loaded at upgrade, or one arriving
// by HA peer-sync, which is exactly the population the metric exists to surface.
//
// `strictReject` lets the caller build the NEGATIVE fixture (overlap, no PBR
// term) through the same helper, so the two differ in one stanza and nothing
// else — the difference the metric is supposed to key on.
