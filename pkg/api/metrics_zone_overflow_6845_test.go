// metrics_zone_overflow_6845_test.go — #6845.
//
// `ProcessStatus.ZoneCounterOverflowActive` was decoded by the Go control plane
// and consumed by NOTHING — no CLI, no REST, no gRPC, no Prometheus. When the
// helper's 63-slot per-zone table overflows, zones past capacity are never
// registered, read as `ErrCounterNotPopulated`, and render as "not available"
// on every surface.
//
// Nothing is misreported by that: an overflowed zone degrades to "not known"
// rather than publishing a false 0. What is missing is the ability to tell WHY,
// because `unpopulated` is three-way ambiguous by construction — pre-#3651
// helper, overflow (traffic genuinely missed), or an idle zone. Only the middle
// one needs action, and the bit separating it was already on the wire.
//
// These cells bind the surfacing, since a decoded-but-unread field is exactly
// what regressed here and a field that no test reads regresses again silently.

// TestZoneCounterOverflowGaugeTracksTheStatus6845 is PAIRED. The overflow leg
// alone is satisfied by a gauge hardwired to 1, which would tell every healthy
// operator to go reduce their zone count; the healthy leg alone is satisfied by
// one hardwired to 0, which is the pre-#6845 blindness with a series attached.
