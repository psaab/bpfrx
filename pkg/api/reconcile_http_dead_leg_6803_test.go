// reconcile_http_dead_leg_6803_test.go — #6803.
//
// ReconcileHTTPS short-circuits a same-address call only when the leg is still
// SERVING:
//
//	case s.httpsLeg.serving() && s.httpsLeg.srv.Addr == addr: return nil
//
// ReconcileHTTP short-circuited on the address alone. An unexpected serve exit
// marks the leg dead and leaves it INSTALLED (it cannot be removed under lifeMu
// without deadlocking a shutdown that races the exit), so the address compare
// matched a corpse and the rebind returned nil having done nothing. The
// management API then stayed down until a daemon restart, whatever the caller
// did.
//
// The cells are PAIRED because this widens a trigger: over-widening it to fire
// on a healthy leg would tear the management socket down and rebuild it on every
// commit — an availability defect traded for an availability defect.

// killHTTPLeg6803 produces an UNEXPECTED serve exit the way production does:
// the listening socket goes away underneath a live Serve loop, which returns a
// non-ErrServerClosed error. It does not poke listenerLeg.dead directly, so the
// cell exercises the path the defect actually arrives on.
