// emitZoneCounterOverflow publishes xpf_zone_counters_overflow_active (#6845).
//
// It lives on the STATUS path rather than beside collectZoneCounters, and that
// placement is the design rather than convenience. collectZoneCounters runs
// ABOVE the dataplane gate on purpose: its gauge is config-derived and must keep
// reporting the full configured zone count through a degraded / config-only boot.
// This flag is the opposite — it is a property of the RUNNING helper's slot
// table. With no helper there is no slot table and no overflow to report, so
// emitting a 0 there would be a false all-clear about a machine that has not
// been asked.
//
// Hence: emitted on every scrape that read a status, absent on every scrape that
// did not. It takes the POINTER and returns early on nil, so that contract is
// stated here and directly testable, rather than inherited from a sibling
// collector's early return where a later refactor could drop it silently.
