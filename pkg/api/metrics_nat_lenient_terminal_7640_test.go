// metrics_nat_lenient_terminal_7640_test.go — #7640.
//
// A NAT rule admitted by the tolerant load / peer-sync / rollback path despite
// the strict terminal-action gate had no live signal at all. The compile-time
// warning reaches an operator through the commit RESPONSE and an apply-time log
// line — and a tolerant LOAD has neither, which is precisely the path on which
// such a rule survives. The node then runs indefinitely carrying a rule a
// commit would refuse.
//
// This binds the WIRING: the record can be correct on the config and the
// operator still sees nothing if the accessor never reaches a Desc.

// TestNATLenientTerminalActionGauge7640 is PAIRED across three points.
//
// The healthy leg is load-bearing: the gauge must publish an explicit 0, not go
// absent, on a clean node. An alert written `xpf_nat_rules_lenient_terminal_action > 0`
// cannot distinguish "none admitted" from "this series stopped being reported",
// so a gauge that vanishes when healthy is the same blindness the metric exists
// to remove.
//
// The two-rule leg rejects a gauge hardwired to 1, which would look right
// against a single-rule fixture and under-report every real config — one
// tolerantly-loaded config commonly carries several such rules, since whatever
// produced one (a pre-gate release, an older peer) produced them all.
