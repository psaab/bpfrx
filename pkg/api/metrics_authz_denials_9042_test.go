// The descriptor was wired into describe() while the emit call was NOT, because
// the neighbouring call site reads `defer c.emitAdmissionRefusals(ch)` and a
// pattern written without `defer` silently matched nothing. A
// described-but-never-emitted metric scrapes as ABSENT — precisely the state
// this issue exists to end — and nothing about either file looks wrong.
//
// Asserted on the SOURCE rather than by calling Collect: Collect dereferences
// c.srv and panics on the nil-server collector these metric tests use, so a
// behavioural check here would need a live server and would be testing the
// harness. The property is "the call exists in Collect", which is exactly what
