// #8580: the REST rule-stats handler computed a rule's action and address match
// from its own copy of the switch, so two fixes that landed in `pkg/natshow`
// were live-defective here — `then source-nat off` reported as `"interface"`,
// its exact opposite (#7640), and an address-book-scoped rule reported as
// `0.0.0.0/0`, i.e. matching every source (#7363).
//
// This cell drives the REAL handler and compares against `pkg/natshow`'s
// answer, not against a literal. Comparing to a literal would encode which
// surface is trusted, and the defect is precisely that the surfaces disagreed
// (#8258's predicate). Comparing to the shared computation also means the cell
// keeps holding if the rendered spelling ever changes deliberately.
