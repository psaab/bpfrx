// #9040: export the dataplane's degraded-path drop counters.
//
// THE COUNTERS ALREADY EXISTED AND WERE UNALERTABLE. `DegradedPathCounters` is
// a reason-keyed map on the helper status; it reaches the status JSON and the
// `show` text render (format/status_sections.go) and stopped there. There was
// no Prometheus series for it anywhere -- so a box dropping transit was visible
// only to an operator who ALREADY suspected it and knew which `show` to run.
// That is the difference between an observable failure and a discoverable one.
//
// The reason that prompted this is `binding_missing`. An interface with more
// than 16 RX queues has its bound set silently capped at
// BINDING_QUEUES_PER_IFACE by the helper planner, and RSS is only reshaped to
// fit that bound on mlx5_core -- every other driver is skipped by an explicit
// driver guard. So the NIC keeps hashing across all Q queues while only 16 are
// bound, and transit landing on the rest takes drop_degraded_transit. The loss
// is roughly (Q-16)/Q on that interface, steady, while the box reads up.
//
// EMITTED ONLY WHEN A STATUS WAS READ, and this is the deliberate half. The
// map is reason-keyed and sparse: a reason that has never fired has no entry,
// so there is no fixed label set to emit zeroes over -- unlike the
// authz-denial and probe-skip counters, whose label sets are enumerable and
// which therefore always emit. Emitting a synthetic zero for a reason we have
// not seen would invent a series whose absence is meaningful, and the absence
// of the whole family already carries the information "no status was read this
// scrape". Same contract as emitZoneCounterOverflow, and stated here rather
// than inherited so a later refactor cannot drop it silently.
//
// Cumulative and process-lifetime; a helper restart resets it, the ordinary
// Prometheus counter contract, handled by rate() at query time.
