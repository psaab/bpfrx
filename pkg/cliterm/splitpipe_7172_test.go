// #7172: SplitPipe is the ONE place a Junos command line is split from its
// output-pipe suffix. It was two byte-identical copies (pkg/cli, cmd/cli) until
// this change.
//
// The corpus below is deliberately shared rather than surface-specific: the
// property being protected is that BOTH CLI surfaces answer "where does the
// command end" identically, because #7172's login-class deny regexes match the
// command and Junos counts the pipe as part of it. A gate and a dispatcher that
// split differently disagree about what the operator ran, and that disagreement
// is the bypass.
