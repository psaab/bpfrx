// #6912. Apply's activation tail does two things only Apply can do: the
// per-interface `networkctl reconfigure` that applies bond/VLAN addresses, and
// restoreSlowPathRPFilter, which re-disables rp_filter on the userspace
// dataplane's slow-path TUN after networkd resets it.
//
// pkg/daemon is a second `networkctl reload` owner and runs one BEFORE
// networkd.Apply on the live day-2 path. When that external reload SUCCEEDS,
// the kernel really does re-read the directory, so the reload obligation is
// genuinely discharged — but the tail was not run, and an external owner
// cannot run it.
//
// The pre-#6912 gate could not see this. With no failed Apply anywhere there
// is nothing for the debt mechanism to carry: changed is false, the reload
// debt was correctly cleared, no reconfigure failed, and this Manager never
// started a pass. Every term was false while the tail had never run, and Apply
// returned nil having left addresses unreconfigured and rp_filter at
// networkd's default — which silently drops locally-originated traffic via the
// TUN.
//
// This is distinct from #5718, which covers a FAILED Apply whose debt a later
// external success clears. Here nothing fails at any point.

// setSlowPathRPFilter models networkd resetting rp_filter on the slow-path TUN,
// which is what a reload does and what the tail exists to undo.
