// errStopBeforeHostReconcile is a #5268-style tripwire (the idiom is
// documented at compiler_rxvlan_failclosed_5268_test.go): a sentinel returned
// by recordingDP.SetZoneConfig AFTER the probe has counted the call. It is
// what makes the control test below safe to run.
//
// compileZones cannot be driven to completion in a unit test. Its tail calls
// stripUnmanagedInterfaces (compiler_iface.go), which enumerates the REAL host
// via net.Interfaces() and, for every link that is not `lo`, not in this config
// and not daemon-owned, runs netlink.AddrDel then netlink.LinkSetDown -- and
// netlink.LinkDel outright for a bond. Measured, not inferred: an instrumented
// panic at compiler_iface.go, stripUnmanagedInterfaces fired on `eno2` through
// TestValidConfigStillReachesZoneCompile_4960 -> CompileConfig -> compileZones,
// with 50+ further links behind it. Unprivileged those netlink calls fail with
// EPERM; as ROOT the test black-holes the host's networking (#6894 r2 F1).
//
// programZoneMaps calls SetZoneConfig once per zone BEFORE iterating that
// zone's interfaces, so failing the FIRST call halts the compile after the
// probe has recorded "compileZones was entered" and before mapZoneInterface --
// therefore before ensureVLANSubInterface, reconcileInterfaceAddresses, the
// ethtool/procfs writes, and the stripUnmanagedInterfaces tail. That is
// strictly stronger than the euid+name skip it replaces, which guarded only
// the two fixture interface names while the hazard was every OTHER link on the
// host.
var errStopBeforeHostReconcile = errors.New(
	"recordingDP tripwire: compileZones was entered (SetZoneConfig reached)")

// recordingDP counts the dataplane calls that mark how far CompileConfig got.
// SetZoneConfig is the probe for host mutation: programZoneMaps calls it once
// per zone BEFORE it iterates that zone's interfaces, and mapZoneInterface --
// the only caller of ensureVLANSubInterface / reconcileInterfaceAddresses, the
// only destructive netlink in the whole compile -- runs inside that iteration.
// So zero SetZoneConfig calls proves compileZones never started, which proves
// no host mutation occurred; one call proves it started and then stopped on the
// tripwire.
//
// zoneConfigCalls is the counter that BINDS the tripwire, and saying so
// plainly is a correction: r2 claimed the two inner counters below "turn the
// safety property into a runtime assertion instead of a structural argument",
// and they do not (#6894 r3 F2). Measured by driving programZoneMaps directly
// with the tripwire neutralised -- which is safe, because
// stripUnmanagedInterfaces is in compileZones (compiler_iface.go, compileZones' stripUnmanagedInterfaces call), not in
// programZoneMaps:
//
//	WITH tripwire:    zoneConfigCalls=1 vlanIfaceInfoCall=0 ifaceSetupCalls=0
//	WITHOUT tripwire: zoneConfigCalls=2 vlanIfaceInfoCall=0 ifaceSetupCalls=0
//
// So zoneConfigCalls distinguishes and the inner two do not. What actually
// holds the control test together is `errors.Is(err, errStopBeforeHostReconcile)`
// -- the tripwire arrived at all -- plus `zoneConfigCalls == 1`, which pins
// that it halted on the FIRST zone rather than walking every zone.
//
// vlanIfaceInfoCall and ifaceSetupCalls are DEFENCE IN DEPTH. Each is reached
// only from inside mapZoneInterface (SetVlanIfaceInfo right after a successful
// ensureVLANSubInterface, SetZone/AddTxPort during the one-time per-phys host
// setup), and mapZoneInterface returns early at compiler_iface.go, mapZoneInterface's early return when
// cachedInterfaceByName misses -- which it always does here, because
// xpft4960a/xpft4960b exist on no host. They would therefore fire only if this
// fixture's interface names ever started resolving. Keep them, and do NOT
// "make them live" by switching to real interface names: that is precisely the
// r2 F1 host hazard, since a resolving name puts reconcileInterfaceAddresses on
// a real link.
