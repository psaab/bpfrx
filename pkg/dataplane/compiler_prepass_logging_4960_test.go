// #6894 r8 F6: the pre-pass must not log SUCCESS for work it did not perform.
//
// Every dataplane write in the pre-pass is a no-op on the discarding shim, yet
// the covered phases logged "static NAT compilation complete", "compiled NAT64
// prefix", "flow timeouts compiled" and friends unconditionally. On a FAILED
// apply an operator therefore read a journal that reported a compile
// succeeding and then failing, for a compile whose result was thrown away.
//
// WARN duplication inside the same phases is deliberately NOT addressed here
// and stays on #6903: a soft-skip diagnostic appearing twice is noise, whereas
// a success record for work that did not happen is a false claim.

// NOT reachable on the pre-pass, and neither is an oversight — both are

//
//   - `SNAT egress IP resolved` — compileNAT's interface-SNAT branch resolves its

//     validateBeforeMutate builds a newValidationResult whose ifCache is EMPTY
//     (only compileZones populates it). The branch soft-skips before the record.
//   - `persistent NAT pool registered` — the shim's GetPersistentNAT returns a
//     typed nil ON PURPOSE (see prePassShimDivergence), so the whole
//     persistent-NAT block is skipped one level up.
//
// Both gates are therefore DEFENSIVE on the pre-pass: they cannot fire on the
// path they nominally protect, and removing either leaves this test green. That
// is stated rather than papered over. Their over-reach arm IS bound —
// gatedRecordWants names both, and the real-pass driver supplies the seeded
