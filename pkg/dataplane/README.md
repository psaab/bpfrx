# pkg/dataplane

> Deprecation notice (#1373): the legacy eBPF backend in this package is being
> retired in favor of the Rust AF_XDP userspace dataplane. Phase 1 updates
> active docs and migration targeting only; no BPF source, loader code, or
> bindings are removed in this phase.

Abstract dataplane interface plus the legacy eBPF backend. Compiles the typed
config from `pkg/config` into BPF-map entries (zones, policies, NAT,
filters, applications), attaches the 14 BPF programs (9 XDP + 5 TC), and
exposes session iteration to GC, the CLI, and the metrics surface.

Pluggable: the legacy eBPF backend registers through `RegisterBackend` for
the old `DataPlane` surface (DPDK retired #1525; removed in #1527/#1528).
Runtime backends register through `RegisterRuntimeBackend`; daemon startup now
selects `userspace.Boot()` directly for the default and explicit userspace
paths and falls through to `NewRuntimeDataPlane` for every other effective
type. Today the operator-facing cases on that branch are the explicit legacy
eBPF rollback and retired-DPDK sentinel; unknown/custom types still surface the
legacy factory's error path verbatim. During the #1381 migration, the userspace
runtime constructor returns `LegacyDataPlaneAdapter`: the userspace `Manager`
itself still does not implement the BPF-shaped `DataPlane`, but daemon status,
CLI, and cluster-sync callers that have not moved to domain interfaces still
receive a temporary compatibility handle.

DPDK retirement (#1525): the historical #1475 policy that retained DPDK as
a separately supported DPDK-build backend is no longer in force. The
`pkg/dataplane/dpdk` bridge, the `cmd/xpfd/main.go` blank registration
import, and the canary allowlist entries were removed in #1527/#1528. The
[`docs/pr/1373-retire-ebpf-dataplane/README.md`](../../docs/pr/1373-retire-ebpf-dataplane/README.md)
"DPDK Backend Retired (#1525)" section now describes the remaining
Phase 1 reject machinery (commit-time `ErrDPDKDataplaneRetired`,
`TypeDPDK` sentinel, runtime `ErrDPDKBackendRetired`) which is kept
for one release cycle to preserve the operator-friendly migration
message for stored-config rolling upgrade.

The userspace backend's status wire format is mirrored here for CLI/API
consumers. CoS queue status includes queue-scoped drain-phase counters so
operators can separate guarantee bytes, surplus bytes, and non-exact bytes
sent while exact queues were still backlogged.

## Shim artifact: pinned toolchain + verifier gates (#1864)

`userspace_xdp_bpfel.o` (the retained Rust AF_XDP shim, built from
`userspace-xdp/`) is **git-tracked and embedded into xpfd via
go:embed** — it is the deployable artifact. `make build` never needs
`make generate`; only regenerate when `userspace-xdp/` source changes.

Why this is guarded: on 2026-06-10 a `make generate` with a drifted
Rust nightly produced an object that exceeded the kernel verifier's
1M processed-insn cap (`BPF program is too large. Processed 1000001
insn`) and put BOTH HA cluster nodes into config-only mode. The
upstream rustc/LLVM change in (nightly-2026-05-23, nightly-2026-05-27]
altered `u64::saturating_sub` lowering in a way that defeats verifier
state pruning; a year-old nightly fails differently — the safe
toolchain set is an interval, so the build pins the toolchain AND
verifies every candidate empirically.

Guard layers (`build-userspace-xdp.sh`):

1. **Toolchain pin** — `userspace-xdp/rust-toolchain.toml` is the
   single source of truth (`channel = "nightly-YYYY-MM-DD"` +
   rust-src). The script parses it strictly (exactly one channel key
   in `[toolchain]`, format-validated) and refuses to build with a
   missing toolchain, printing the exact `rustup toolchain install`
   line. bpf-linker is version-pinned too (it embeds its own LLVM);
   the script version-checks the exact PATH-resolved binary cargo
   executes.
2. **Verify-then-install** — the cargo output is loaded through the
   real kernel verifier (`cmd/shimverify`: anonymous maps, no pins,
   no attach, plus the same `validateUserspaceShimSpec` checks the
   daemon runs) BEFORE the tracked `.o` is touched. REJECT or missing
   privileges (root / passwordless sudo) ⇒ tracked object untouched,
   nonzero exit, actionable message. There is no unverified-install
   path. `RUST_BPF_TOOLCHAIN=...` overrides the pin for bisects, but
   installing an unpinned object additionally requires
   `XPF_SHIM_ALLOW_UNPINNED_INSTALL=1`.
3. **Deploy pre-flight** — `xpfd verify-dataplane` runs the same
   verify-only load against the object embedded in the invoked
   binary (exit 0 PASS / 3 verifier REJECT / 1 other).
   `test/incus/cluster-setup.sh deploy_vm()` pushes the new binary to
   a temp path and runs this BEFORE stopping the old daemon — a
   REJECT refuses the deploy with the old dataplane still forwarding.
4. **Tests** — root-gated `TestVerifyEmbeddedUserspaceShim` catches a
   bad tracked artifact in privileged `make test`;
   `TestVerifyUserspaceShimShrinkEquivalence` proves the verify-only
   hash-map MaxEntries shrink (memory hygiene for live-node
   pre-flights) never changes the verifier verdict, using the
   preserved incident object in `testdata/`.

**Recovery runbook** (symptom: `load Rust xdp_userspace collection:
... BPF program is too large. Processed 1000001 insn`, daemon in
config-only mode):

```
git checkout -- pkg/dataplane/userspace_xdp_bpfel.o
make build
# redeploy; do NOT run make generate until the toolchain matches the pin
```

**Pin-bump procedure**: edit `userspace-xdp/rust-toolchain.toml` (and
`PINNED_BPF_LINKER_VERSION` in `build-userspace-xdp.sh` if bumping the
linker), run `make generate` (the verifier gate must PASS), commit the
regenerated `.o` together with the pin change, and require a clean
`git diff --exit-code pkg/dataplane/userspace_xdp_bpfel.o` after a
pinned re-run (builds are bit-for-bit reproducible for a given pin)
plus a cluster smoke before merge.

## Entry points

- `DataPlane` — `dataplane.go`. Legacy BPF-shaped interface kept for the
  legacy eBPF compiler and compatibility adapters (DPDK retired #1525). New
  daemon-facing code should not add methods here.
- DPDK backend deleted in #1528 (umbrella #1525). The `pkg/dataplane/dpdk`
  package no longer exists.
- `RuntimeDataPlane`, `ConfigSink`, `SessionStore`, `Telemetry`,
  `HAController`, and `LinkController` — `apply.go` and `session_store.go`.
  These are the split-domain interfaces used by daemon startup and runtime
  subsystems. `ConfigSink.ApplyConfig` is the daemon's apply-time
  compile/config entry point; userspace AF_XDP does not need to implement the
  legacy BPF-shaped `Compile` method just to receive committed config.
- `NewRuntimeDataPlane(dpType)` — `dataplane.go`. Runtime-domain constructor
  kept for the explicit legacy eBPF rollback, the retired-DPDK sentinel, and
  compatibility/test seams such as the userspace runtime registry round-trip.
  The daemon's default and explicit userspace boot path now goes through
  `userspace.Boot()` via `pkg/daemon/buildRuntimeDataPlane()`. The current
  userspace constructor still returns a compatibility adapter around
  `*userspace.Manager` until the remaining status/session-sync callers stop
  requiring `DataPlane`.
- `Manager` — `loader.go`. eBPF implementation.
- `New() *Manager` — `loader.go`.
- `Compile(cfg *config.Config) (*CompileResult, error)` — multi-phase
  lowering to BPF map entries. Phases live in `compiler.go`: zone IDs,
  screen profile IDs, zones, address book, applications, policies,
  NAT, static NAT, NAT64 prefixes, NPTv6, screen profiles, default
  policy, flow timeouts, firewall filters, flow config, port
  mirroring.
- `CompileResult` — `compiler.go`. Zone/policy/NAT/app IDs, compiled
  policy-scheduler rule slots, and the per-interface networkd configs.
- Session iteration: `IterateSessions`, `BatchIterateSessions`,
  `IterateSessionsV6`, `BatchIterateSessionsV6`.
- Session domain adapters: `SessionStoreOf`, `TelemetryOf`, and
  `NewDataPlaneSessionStore`. The generic `DataPlane` adapter preserves the
  batch-iteration fast path and centralizes cluster/GC companion ownership:
  cluster-synced forward installs create reverse and DNAT companions and roll
  back session writes if companion creation fails. Iteration callers that
  already have the session value must delete through `DeleteKnown*` or
  `DeleteBatchKnown*` so reverse/DNAT cleanup uses the authoritative
  iterator value, preserves persistent-NAT bindings, and keeps the batched
  map-delete fast path. `DeleteWithCompanions*` is retained for key-only
  HA delete messages.

## BPF verifier and kernel constraints

These are the project's recurring traps. Read CLAUDE.md for the
authoritative list; quick recap:

- Branch merges lose packet range — re-read `ctx->data` / `ctx->data_end`
  after any branch.
- 512-byte combined stack across call frames — push large locals into
  scratch maps; mark big helpers `__noinline`.
- Variable-offset packet pointers lose range when `var_off` is wide
  (0xffff). Use a constant offset from a validated pointer.
- Mask `meta->l3_offset` (u16) with `& 0x3F` before packet-pointer
  arithmetic so the verifier can track the range (commit `66833c5`).
- `__u16` causes sign-extension (`smin=-32768`) — fails for packet-pointer
  math.
- Pointer bitwise OR is rejected (`if (sv4 || sv6)` where both are
  pointers triggers a compiler `|=` on pointer registers). Use separate
  null checks.
- xdp_zone fails the verifier on kernel 6.12 (NAT64 complexity); passes
  on 6.18+.

## SR-IOV / driver constraints

- iavf (VF) has no native XDP — generic mode only, ~16% CPU loss.
  i40e/ice on the PF have native XDP.
- `bpf_redirect_map` requires `ndo_xdp_xmit` on the target. Mixing native
  + generic interfaces in a redirect set silently drops.
- Workaround: per-interface `redirect_capable` flag in `bpf/xdp/xdp_forward.c`.
  Non-native interfaces fall back to `XDP_PASS` (kernel forwarding).
- The lab uses PF passthrough (i40e) on the WAN interface; all other
  interfaces are virtio with native XDP. Per-VF passthrough would need
  generic XDP and hit the iavf cliff.

## Flow export ownership

Flow export (NetFlow v9 / IPFIX) is owned by `pkg/flowexport` on the
**control plane**, driven by `pkg/logging.EventReader` SESSION_CLOSE
events. The userspace dataplane does NOT emit flow packets. The Rust
dataplane once carried a dead `FlowExporter` plus a write-only
`flow_export_config` field that emitted nothing; both were removed in
#2130. The Go→Rust `flow_export` snapshot wire field is retained as
reserved/ignored (the helper deserializes and drops it) to preserve the
#1977 decode-safety tests and avoid a wire-protocol break.

## Byte order

Use `binary.NativeEndian.Uint32(ip4)` for `__be32` BPF fields, **not**
`BigEndian`. cilium/ebpf serializes map values in native endian; the IP
bytes are already in network order on the wire.
