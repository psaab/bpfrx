// #6894 r5 F1: the pre-pass fake must not be MORE PERMISSIVE than the dataplane
// production actually compiles against.
//
// The concern is real in the abstract: discardingDataPlane answers every write
// with nil, so if the production dataplane validated its arguments and returned
// an error, a config could clear the pre-pass, let compileZones mutate the
// host, and then fail in a later phase -- the exact half-applied state #4960
// exists to prevent, produced by the guard meant to close it.
//
// A review round raised it against (*Manager).SetAddressBookEntry
// (maps_policy.go), which does call net.ParseCIDR and does return an error.
// That method belongs to the RETIRED eBPF backend: NewDataPlane and
// NewRuntimeDataPlane both refuse TypeEBPF with ErrEBPFBackendRetired
// (dataplane.go), so no production apply reaches it. What production compiles
// against is userspaceShimCompileDataplane (loader.go), passed by
// CompileUserspaceShim and reached via userspace.Manager.ApplyConfig ->
// .Compile. Its SetAddressBookEntry is a bare `return nil`, so for THAT method
// the fake and production agree exactly and the reported chain does not exist.
//
// This test deliberately does NOT require the fake to validate. Teaching it to
// ParseCIDR would make the PRE-PASS STRICTER than production and reject at
// commit configs the runtime accepts -- an empty address-book `value` is a
// deliberate WARNING, not a reject (compiler_validate_warn.go, #2229), and this
// gate has already swung through over-rejection twice.
//
// WHAT IT DOES CHECK, and why the shape matters. The equivalence is a PROPERTY
// OF THE SHIM, not a law, so:
//
//   - The DataPlane method set is enumerated by REFLECTION, not hardcoded. A
//     hardcoded list silently stops covering methods added later, which is the
//     precise failure this test exists to prevent.
//   - Method bodies are classified by AST, because reflection cannot see them:
//     for an embedded *Manager, Go synthesizes a wrapper on the outer type, so
//     a PROMOTED method is indistinguishable from an overridden one at runtime.
//     That distinction is the whole point -- an un-overridden compile-surface
//     method falls through to the eBPF Manager, which is exactly where the
//     validating implementations live.
//   - Every divergence is allowlisted WITH a reason, and the allowlist is
//     asserted MINIMAL, so it cannot rot into a dumping ground.

// rationale named ClearPoolConfigs and SetPoolConfig and said "neither returns
// an error" — a two-item word for a set that also contains RegisterNATIP, which

// third.
//
// Naming three would have the same decay, one call later. So derive the set:
// find every method called on `pnat` inside compileNAT, then assert each of
// those methods is declared with an EMPTY result list. A fourth call is covered
// the moment it is written.
//
// It also discharges an obligation that previously had NO consumer at all. The
// exemption said "if either ever gains an error return this entry must go" —
// but both call sites are bare statements, so adding an error return compiles
// silently at both and nothing observes the transition. This assertion fires on
