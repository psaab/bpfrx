// #8241: a verifier-headroom figure must carry either the COMMIT it was measured
// at or the FLOOR it is measured against. Bare figures satisfying neither rot
// silently, and this has now recurred three times independently:
//
//   - #7494's table read 777,901 / 22.21% measured at 9e28d1c25, while the object
//     was 801,448 / 19.86%;
//   - verify_userspace_shim.go and README.md carried 784,175 / 21.58%, stale by
//     17,273;
//   - docs/log/6886.md corrected ITSELF the same day: "the slack figure first
//     recorded here was stale on arrival. #7720 raised the floor to 15% while this
//     work was in flight and I merged master in without re-reading my own sentence."
//
// THE MEASUREMENT WAS NEVER MISSING. docs/log/6886.md:31 has recorded
// 784,175 -> 801,448 all along. The failure is that the measurement did not
// PROPAGATE out of the log, which is why this is a census and not a campaign of
// corrected sentences: the correct sentence already existed one directory over.
//
// WHY A DATE IS NOT ENOUGH, and it is not hypothetical. README.md's #6884 block
// said "Re-measured 2026-08-27" and gave 784,175 / 21.58%. Commit eaf589bac landed
// the SAME DAY and moved the object to 801,448 / 19.86%. So that date names two
// different budgets and a reader cannot tell which. It now cites 3cfca758e.
//
// SCOPE. Deliberately narrow, and NOT by the word "headroom". A census over bare
// "headroom" is disproportionate and fires on unrelated senses that are numerous
// and correct -- ECN/WRED buffer headroom, CPU headroom, latency-budget headroom,
// pkg/ddns's protocol margin. Measured: a naive scan flagged 47 sites, almost all
// session-count caps, bps conversions and review archives. This walks the NORMATIVE
// texts only -- the ones a reader consults to learn the CURRENT budget. Archives
// (docs/log, docs/reviews, docs/pr, docs/research, _Log.md) are dated by
// construction and are records of the past, not claims about now.
