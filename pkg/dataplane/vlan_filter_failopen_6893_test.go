// #6893 — THE PAYLOAD PROOF for the VLAN-sub-interface fail-open.
//
// The filed harm: a VLAN sub-interface that fails to be created is soft-skipped
// by compileZones, compileFirewallFilters then resolves the same name, misses,
// and `continue`s — so the operator commits a config containing a filter
// binding, the commit reports SUCCESS, and the filter is not applied. A filter
// that is absent permits what it was configured to deny.
//
// This cell demonstrates that outcome rather than assuming it, which is what
// makes the record it also asserts worth having: an absence claim is only as
// good as the payload's ability to produce what it asserts is absent.
//
// The seam is `ifCache`. Seeding the PHYSICAL interface and leaving the VLAN
// child absent reproduces exactly the post-soft-skip state — the parent
// resolves, `ge-0-0-2.50` does not — with no netlink and no privileges.
//
// WHAT PART 2 CHANGED, and a correction to what this comment used to predict.
// It said the `err != nil` assertion here would INVERT once a VLAN creation
// failure failed the apply. It does not, and the anticipation named the wrong
// function: part 2's guard is in `mapZoneInterface`, and `compileZones` runs
// BEFORE `compileFirewallFilters` (compiler.go :304 and :366, both
// `if err != nil { return }`). So a creation failure now aborts the apply
// before this function is ever reached.
//
// This cell therefore still describes `compileFirewallFilters` in isolation
// truthfully — that is exactly what it does when handed an unresolvable
// sub-interface — but the route it models is no longer reachable through a
// creation failure. It stays reachable through the ABSENT-PHYSICAL skip, which
// part 2 deliberately leaves soft, so the cell is still guarding a live path.
//
// The done-signal idea was right and its location was wrong. Part 2's own
// paired proof lives at the layer the guard is in
// (vlan_create_failclosed_6893_test.go).
