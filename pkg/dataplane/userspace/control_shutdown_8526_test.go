// WHAT THE INSTRUMENT WOULD SAY IF THE PROPERTY WERE FALSE. Every cell here
// is time-bounded with an explicit `select`, because the failure mode under
// test is a HANG: a mutant that reintroduces the unbounded hold does not
// return a wrong value, it fails to return. A cell that waited on an
// unbuffered channel would be a VOID (the mutation neither passes nor fails),
// so each bound is chosen strictly between the fixed behaviour (sub-second)
// and the mutant behaviour (the full scaled deadline, ~10s here).
//
// stalledRoundTripFloor sizes the request so the scaled round-trip deadline is
// far larger than any bound below: a mutant that loses the cut runs for
// controlRoundtripDeadline(bodyLen), and that must be unmistakably longer than
// the assertion window or the cell is measuring noise.
