// #6640 — the ENFORCEMENT half of the shared-view claim.
//
// The commit-time advisory in pkg/config used to re-derive its own
// approximation of this package's override resolution, so the two reasoned
// about different objects and the advisory contradicted enforcement. The fix
// moved the resolution into pkg/config (ResolveInterfaceHostInbound) and made
// this package delegate to it.
//
// A claim that two callers SHARE a function is only worth what a mutation can
// show, so this test is deliberately anchored to the same fixture as
// pkg/config/host_inbound_advisory_effective_view_6640_test.go
// (`hostInbound6640PhysicalUnit`, reproduced here because the packages cannot
// share test helpers). Breaking config.ResolveInterfaceHostInbound — dropping
// the #3720 physical->unit merge, say — must red BOTH files. If only the
// advisory reds, they are not actually sharing it and the fix is a fourth copy
// of enforcement semantics rather than the end of the class.
