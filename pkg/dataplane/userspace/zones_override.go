// effectiveHostInboundTokens returns the EFFECTIVE host-inbound system-service
// and protocol token sets for an interface (#3362), lower-cased, trimmed and
// de-duplicated for map keying. Either argument may be nil.
//
// #6515: an interface that declares a `host-inbound-traffic` stanza is described
// ENTIRELY by it — the zone-level set is REPLACED, not unioned ("Interface
// configuration overrides that of the zone", Junos Security Zones). Presence of
// the stanza, not emptiness, is the discriminator: ifaceHI non-nil means the
// operator authored one, and an explicitly empty one is a deny-all override. The
// decision itself is config.EffectiveHostInboundTokens, shared with the display
// surfaces, the commit-time advisories and the duplicate-host-address gate, so
// enforcement and every description of it act on ONE object. Before #3226 this
// file owned its own combination and the advisories computed a per-RAW-STANZA
// view, so the two reasoned about DIFFERENT objects and the advice contradicted
// enforcement (a zone-level `any-service` with a per-interface `rpm` warned rpm
// was DENIED while this builder admitted it). This wrapper keeps the lower-casing
// the dataplane needs for map keying — the shared config helper preserves
// authored case for the display surfaces.
//
// Before #6515 this was a UNION (unionHostInboundTokens), so an interface stanza
// could only ever WIDEN admission relative to the zone.
// #7490 added the (zone, ref) pair in place of the bare zone stanza. The
// zone-level `dhcp` / `bootp` authorization is withheld from an interface that
// runs a DHCP server or relay, which is a per-INTERFACE answer, so a builder
// that passed only the zone's *HostInboundTraffic could not express it. Taking
// the zone and the ref rather than a pre-filtered list is deliberate: it makes
// every enforcement call site name the interface it is resolving FOR, and a
// site that cannot name one is a site that was substituting the zone answer for
// a per-interface one — which is the bug class this signature now refuses to
// compile.
//
// ref may be empty for the deliberate zone-DEFAULT group (the seed view that
// non-overridden interfaces accumulate into); an empty ref withholds nothing,
// and a withheld interface simply lands in its own group with its own
// signature.

// dedup, so it would leak that duplicate into the dataplane view — harmless for
// the classifier, which is set-based, but a gratuitous change to a snapshot
// other tests compare exactly. Dedup on the LOWER-CASED token, exactly as this
