// #7284: the lifeline exclusion in the REAL host-inbound table was an INTERFACE
// exclusion, not an address-VALUE one. Every host-inbound drop is
// destination-address-only with no iifname (#3718), so a management address
// shared onto a second interface was denied by the real table regardless of the
// lifeline it also lives on — and, through the shared #5566 set, its ESTABLISHED
// session was torn down on the next apply.
//
// The FENCE already partitioned per address value (#6492); these tests pin the
// real table to the same rule, with two deliberate limits: it applies only where
// a view would deny with NO accept, and only to addresses actually on a
// lifeline.
