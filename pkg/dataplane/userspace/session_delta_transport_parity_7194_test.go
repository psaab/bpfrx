// session_delta_transport_parity_7194_test.go — #7194 item 1.
//
// xpf has two HA session-open transports and, until this file, nothing that
// made them equivalent — only the discipline of remembering to edit both.
//
// The evidence #5865 collected is the whole argument for this test. Five fields
// existed on the binary open frame and the Go consumer but not on the Rust JSON
// producer, so the JSON leg installed zeros. Worse, the Go struct's own doc
// comment asserted those fields were "mirrored on the JSON RPC-fallback delta",
// and that sentence was FALSE from the day it was written — nothing detected it,
// because nothing compared the two transports. #6312 is the recurrence: a field
// added to the binary leg in #5212 reached the JSON leg one issue later.
//
// The parity itself is currently CORRECT — #6949 closed the five-field gap, and
// both sides carry 41 fields as of this commit. That is what this test is for.
// It is a REGRESSION GUARD, not a fix: it exists so the next field added to one
// leg reds the suite instead of shipping, which is precisely what did not happen
// the last two times.
//
// WHY IT COMPARES WIRE NAMES AND NOT FIELD NAMES.
//
// The Rust struct carries 35 `#[serde(rename = "...")]` attributes and the Go
// struct carries json tags. Today every rename is an identity rename, so a
// field-name comparison would also pass — and would keep passing through a
// future rename that broke the wire while leaving both field names alone. The
// contract between these two programs is the JSON on the wire, so that is what
// is compared. Pinning the field names instead would encode the wrong SSOT.

// The wire name of a Go field: the json tag before any option, falling back to
// the field name. `json:"-"` means the field is not on the wire at all.
