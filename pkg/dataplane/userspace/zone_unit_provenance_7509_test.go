// #7509: pin the Go-side facts the Rust INGRESS refusal rests on.
//
// #6727 and #8407 both recorded that separating a base row whose zone the
// operator AUTHORED from one that merely INHERITED a sibling unit's zone needs
// a fact that "is not on the wire", and #8407 stopped at the zoned-vs-zoned
// contest for that reason. The fact is on the wire — just not on the row that
// needs it. It is in the row's UNIT SIBLINGS on the same ifindex:
//
//   - `InterfaceZoneMap` (pkg/config/host_inbound_effective_view.go) fans a
//     BARE `security-zone <z> interfaces <ifc>` reference DOWN onto every
//     configured unit, so an AUTHORED base has unit rows carrying its zone.
//   - It fans a UNIT-SUFFIXED reference UP to the base and NOT down to the
//     base's other units, so an INHERITED base has unit rows that do not.
//
// The base row is byte-identical in both. The unit siblings are not. Every cell
// below measures one half of that, plus the scope boundary that keeps the
// #921/#3618 trunk-parent inheritance intact.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore the fan-DOWN's `continue` for a bare reference (or
// add a fan-down for a unit-suffixed one) in InterfaceZoneMap and
// TestUnitSiblingsCarryTheAuthoredVsInheritedFact_7509 goes RED on the arm that
// changed. That is the signal the Rust-side refusal in
// `forwarding_build/interfaces.rs` has lost its discriminator, not a reason to
// re-point this test.

// TestUnitSiblingsCarryTheAuthoredVsInheritedFact_7509 is the discriminator
// itself, stated as the one thing that differs between two configs whose BASE
// rows are identical.
