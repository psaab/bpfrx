// TestTunnelEndpointDeviceIsCoSourced6941 binds the invariant that a tunnel
// endpoint's LinuxName and Ifindex come from ONE interface row.
//
// WHY THIS NEEDS A GUARD (#6941). For an interface-level `tunnel mode
// wireguard` whose LOWEST configured unit carries its own `tunnel` stanza, the
// emitted endpoint is keyed by that unit ref (#1910) while carrying the
// INTERFACE-level tunnel object. So routing materialises `wg0` from
// `ifc.Tunnel` (pkg/daemon/daemon_run_routehelpers.go -> pkg/routing/tunnel.go)
// while the dataplane binds the endpoint to `wg0u3`, the unit's device. The
// obvious repair is to make one side "agree" with the other. BOTH obvious
// repairs are outages, and neither is otherwise detectable:
//
//   - Setting the endpoint's LinuxName from the tunnel object while leaving
//     Ifindex alone breaks co-sourcing. userspace-dp compares
//     `endpoint.linux_name` against `ifindex_to_name[logical_ifindex]` in three
//     coherence gates (afxdp/coordinator/tunnel_supervision.rs
//     `wg_tombstone_respawn_coherent` :969-975, its GRE twin :502-507, and the
//     deferred prune :397-402). Today both read `wg0u3` and the gate passes;
//     after that edit they read `wg0` and `wg0u3`, so a tombstoned WireGuard
//     control thread NEVER RESPAWNS — a silent permanent outage after any
//     thread death.
//   - Repointing Ifindex at the parent row is worse: `logical_ifindex` becomes
//     `egress_ifindex` (afxdp/forwarding/tunnel.rs:74) and therefore the to-zone
//     every policy matches on, it keys `tunnel_endpoint_by_ifindex` (so a route
//     `next-hop @wg0.3` would stamp tunnel_endpoint_id 0 and never encapsulate),
//     and every live session stores the old value, so three re-ownership gates
//     turn those sessions drop-only.
//
// This test does NOT assert which device is correct — that is the open design
// question in #6941, and the answer is not "make these two strings match".
// It asserts only that whatever row the builder picks, it takes BOTH fields
// from that one row, so any future repair that desynchronises them fails here
// instead of in a tunnel that stops respawning in the field.
//
// THE DIVERGENT SHAPE IS IN THE FIXTURE ON PURPOSE. In every other tunnel shape
// the endpoint's tunnel object and its unit row already resolve to the same
// device name, so a mutation that swapped the source of LinuxName would be
// invisible: the two candidate values are equal. Only the divergent shape makes
// them differ, which is what gives this guard its teeth.
