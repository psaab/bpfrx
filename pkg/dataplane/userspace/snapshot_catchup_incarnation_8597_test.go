// #8597 K82: the status-loop catch-up branch in syncSnapshotLocked trusted a
// generation number ACROSS Manager incarnations.
//
// `m.generation` is per-incarnation and lives only in memory (manager.go), so a
// generation reported by a helper that outlived a daemon restart is not
// comparable to this incarnation's counter at all. process.go returns WITHOUT
// restarting the helper when the config is equal and the ping succeeds, so a
// retained helper keeps reporting the previous incarnation's
// LastSnapshotGeneration — which is >= this Manager's first snapshot for any
// prior value.
//
// The branch then mirrored the full successful-apply bookkeeping (marking the
// snapshot published AND applied, stamping the content hash) for a snapshot it
// never sent, and the `publishedSnapshot >= lastSnapshot.Generation` gate at the
// top then suppressed the publish until a later commit moved the generation past
// the stale one. The helper is running the OLD configuration throughout while the
// daemon's bookkeeping says the new one was applied.
//
// The evidence the branch was missing is `publishedSnapshot != 0`: until THIS
// Manager has published something, no generation the helper reports says
// anything about what it holds.
//
// SCOPE — read before extending. This drives the branch directly with the state
// a restart-with-retained-helper produces. It does NOT drive the restart
// interleaving end to end (the status loop racing the compile path's publish),
// which is why #8597 records K82 as mechanism-real with the full interleaving
// not live-driven. What is pinned here is the branch's contract: given a
// generation from an incarnation that never published, do not claim it was
// applied.

// seedRetainedHelperGeneration8597 models a FRESH Manager (nothing published
// this incarnation) whose retained helper still reports a high generation from
// the previous one.
