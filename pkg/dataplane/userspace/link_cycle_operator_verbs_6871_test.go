// #6871 F2: the SIXTH producer of the worker-respawn class.
//
// SetForwardingArmed / SetQueueState / SetBindingState take only m.mu. They are
// reachable exclusively from outside the daemon — `request chassis cluster
// data-plane userspace forwarding|queue|binding ...` in the CLI
// (cli_request_chassis.go) and gRPC SystemAction
// (server_diag_system_action.go) — and neither call site is serialized on the
// daemon's applySem; there is no applySem use anywhere in pkg/cli or
// pkg/grpcapi. Each lands in a helper handler that reaches afxdp.reconcile and
// SPAWNS WORKER THREADS: handlers/forwarding.rs calls reconcile_status_bindings
// unconditionally, handlers/binding.rs and handlers/queue.rs on
// registration_changed.
//
// So an operator (or an automation) issuing one of these in the window
// PrepareLinkCycle opens — workers joined, daemon not yet at setDown, up to
// externalCommandTimeout of `ethtool` per RETH member still to run — respawns
// worker threads into a NIC that is about to unmap their UMEM. That is the
// use-after-unmap #5103 exists to prevent.
//
// The ctrl gate in applyHelperStatusLocked does not cover it: it holds
// ctrl.Enabled=0 correctly, but the spawn happens INSIDE the helper, before the
// response this manager applies, so the gate cannot un-spawn it.
//
// THE OBSERVABLE IS THE REQUEST STREAM, not the error. A gate that returned an
// error but still sent the request would leave the workers spawned and the
// defect intact, so these assert on what actually reached the helper. Both
// halves are checked: the refusal is reported to the operator AND nothing
// crossed the socket.
//
// Deliberately NO BPF maps, so these RUN unprivileged rather than SKIP. That is
// also why the success side asserts "the request reached the helper" rather than
// "the call returned nil": without a ctrl map applyHelperStatusLocked cannot
// complete, which is a fixture limit, not a refusal. errors.Is against the
// sentinel keeps the two apart.
