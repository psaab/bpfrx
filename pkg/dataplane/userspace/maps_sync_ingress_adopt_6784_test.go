// TestFreshManagerReapsPrepopulatedIngressRows6784 is the #6784 fail-on-revert
// test, and it is the test the issue's own fix direction asked for: "test a new
// manager against stale prepopulated pins".
//
// userspace_ingress_ifaces is PinByName-pinned at /sys/fs/bpf/xpf, so its rows
// outlive xpfd. m.lastIngressIfaces does not — it is an ordinary Manager field
// that starts nil. Before #6784 the reap loop in syncIngressIfaceMapLocked
// scanned that empty inventory, so the FIRST sync after a daemon restart
// deleted nothing and every row the previous process left behind survived. The
// row is not inert: the XDP shim reads this map on every packet and a present
// non-zero row is what diverts traffic away from cpumap_or_pass into the AF_XDP
// redirect path, so a stale row keeps steering a de-configured interface.
//
// Both cases below start from a FRESH Manager (New(), inventory nil) against a
// map that already holds rows, exactly as a restart finds it.
//
//   - overlap: some prepopulated rows are still in the config and some are not.
//     This is the case that needs the reap to be SELECTIVE — it fails a fix that
//     adopts and then deletes everything, as well as one that reaps nothing.
//   - no-overlap: nothing prepopulated is still configured. This is the
//     interface-deleted-while-xpfd-was-down / ifindex-reused shape.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: dropping the adoptIngressInventoryLocked call (or making it a
// no-op) leaves `prior` empty on the first pass, so the stale rows survive and
// the "must be gone" assertion goes RED with the stale ifindex named.
//
// PRIVILEGE NOTE: like the #6537 tests it extends, this needs real BPF maps and
// SKIPs unprivileged. The #6784 mutation matrix was run under sudo so these
// cells actually executed; a SKIP here is not a pass.
