// #9337: the #7468 atomic retain was UNSOUND on the deferred-publish path.
//
// retainPreviousClassifierPlanLocked treats m.lastSnapshot as "the snapshot the
// helper is still enforcing". That is true at every publish site except one:
// applyCompiledSnapshot's pendingXSKStartup branch assigns m.lastSnapshot = snap
// and RETURNS, deferring the publish to syncSnapshotLocked. syncSnapshotLocked
// then publishes m.lastSnapshot ITSELF, so on an in-band {"ok":false} the
// "rollback" re-syncs the classifier maps to the very plan the helper just
// refused, reports success, and leaves ctrl at Enabled=1 — the shim keeps
// steering transit against a plan the helper never accepted while the helper
// enforces the previous-good one. That is the #4959 fail-open, reintroduced by
// its own remedy.
//
// The privileged guard for the deferred path
// (TestDeferredPublishRejectedFailsClosed4959) could not see it, and the reason
// is worth recording because it is the general shape: it reached ctrl.Enabled=0
// through the WRONG BRANCH. Its harness loads no classifier maps, so the
// rollback failed with "userspace_ingress_ifaces map not loaded" and fell into
// the ctrl-disable fallback. The cell asserted the right outcome for a reason
// that does not exist in production, where the maps ARE loaded and the rollback
// succeeds. These cells install the syncClassifierMapsHook seam so the rollback
// SUCCEEDS, which is the only configuration in which the defect is observable.
//
// They are unprivileged by construction: the observable is the snapshot
// IDENTITY handed to the classifier sync, not a BPF map.

// deferredPublishFixture9337 models the manager exactly as the pendingXSKStartup
// deferral leaves it: m.lastSnapshot is the snapshot awaiting publication and
// m.publishedSnapshot still names the older generation the helper is enforcing.
