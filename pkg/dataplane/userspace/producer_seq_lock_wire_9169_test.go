// #9169: the helper's process-global event-stream `producer_seq_lock` is the
// FOURTH #4800 new-flow contention site. Every session delta — Open as well as
// Close — allocates its wire sequence number and encodes its frame inside that
// mutex, because #3878 F-152 requires the allocation and the channel enqueue to
// be atomic together. `docs/userspace-newflow-ceiling.md` named three sites and
// not this one, so a run bound here reported a real plateau with every named
// site cold.
//
// This file pins the WIRE for the counter pair that closes that gap, in the
// same shape as the #6842 / #6929 guards: neither side is pinned to a literal.
// The Rust key is read out of the `#[serde(rename = ...)]` attribute, the Go key
// out of the struct tag by reflection, and the test asserts they AGREE. A
// literal would encode which of the two spellings is trusted, and the failure
// being guarded is that one plane moved and the other did not.
//
// WHY THIS PAIR NEEDS THE GUARD. Both fields are additive: `default` on the
// Rust side, `omitempty` on the Go side. A key mismatch therefore never fails a
// decode — the counter reads 0 forever. And 0 is not a suspicious reading here,
// it is the reading the #4800 analyzer prints as `ratio: None`, "never taken",
// for a mutex that is in fact taken on every single delta. The instrument would
// look present and say nothing, which is worse than its absence: absence at
// least left the site unnamed rather than exonerated.
