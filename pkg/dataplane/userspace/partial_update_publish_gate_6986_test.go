// #6986: a PARTIAL update (update_neighbors / update_fabrics) must never claim
// that a Compile-DEFERRED full snapshot has been published.
//
// The two writebacks — RegenerateNeighborSnapshot and
// persistResolvedFabricsLocked — advance the generation so the partial-rebuild
// publish paths carry their mutation forward. Neither sends an apply_snapshot.
// When they also advanced publishedSnapshot unconditionally, they closed the
// level-triggered gate the status tick uses (publishedSnapshot <
// lastSnapshot.Generation), and the full snapshot Compile had deferred —
// policies, routes, interfaces, NAT — was never sent while the bookkeeping said
// it had been.
//
// These tests assert the END property, not the bookkeeping: the deferred
// content REACHES THE HELPER. That matters because the swallow has TWO
// independent kills. Fixing only publishedSnapshot leaves lastSnapshotHash
// refreshed from a snapshot that was never sent, and syncSnapshotLocked's
// content-dedup then returns without publishing anyway. A test that asserted
// only "publishedSnapshot is still behind" would pass against that half-fix.

// partialUpdateHarness6986 is the #5306 fabric-writeback harness, reused: a
// real Manager over a unix control socket that records every ControlRequest.
