// #7468 / #6707 consequence 1: a rejected policy snapshot disabled
// userspace_ctrl instead of performing an atomic retain.
//
// On the samePlanRefresh path the classifier BPF maps are rewritten to the NEW
// plan BEFORE the publish, so when the helper refuses the snapshot and keeps
// the old one the maps and the enforced snapshot disagree. The pre-#7468
// response was to disable ctrl — correct, but it drops ALL transit for up to a
// second (until the 1 Hz tick re-syncs from m.lastSnapshot) on every rejected
// policy update, and on a FIRST apply it returned before the status loop was
// ever started, so nothing ever re-synced and transit stayed dropped.
//
// #6707's own fix direction — "do not disable ctrl when the helper retained a
// usable snapshot" — is UNSAFE as written and is not what this implements: it
// would leave the maps a generation AHEAD of the enforced snapshot, which is
// the #4959 fail-open. The fix rolls the maps BACK so ctrl can stay enabled
// against a plan that MATCHES what the helper is enforcing.
//
// The discriminator is the error class, and it is the part most worth reading.
// Only an in-band {"ok":false} proves the helper still holds m.lastSnapshot. A
// transport failure proves nothing: controlRoundtripDeadline exists because a
// fixed 3s deadline once "reported the apply FAILED while the dataplane had
// applied it live". Rolling the maps back there would put them a generation
// BEHIND the enforced snapshot — the same fail-open with the sign flipped.

// TestHelperInBandRefusalIsClassified7468 binds the sentinel to the REAL
