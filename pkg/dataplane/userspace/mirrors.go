// buildMirrorConfigSnapshots resolves forwarding-options port-mirroring into
// the per-ingress mirror table. The table contract is one output per ingress
// ifindex, so a duplicate ingress ifindex (the same physical interface used as
// an ingress source by more than one instance) or a negative sampling rate is
// a SCOPE-DROP: the offending entry is skipped with a specific warning and the
// remaining valid entries are still published (#3972). One typo must never
// silently disable ALL mirroring.
//
// config.compilePortMirroring already HARD-REJECTS these cases at commit time,
// so this scope-drop is defense-in-depth for a config that reaches the
// snapshot builder without passing the commit gate (e.g. a stale on-disk
// config written by an older build). It replaces the pre-#3972
// whole-table-fail-closed-on-warn behavior that dropped every valid mirror
// session on a single bad entry.
// MirrorExclusion records ONE port-mirroring entry the builder refused to
// install, and why (#7357 §2).
//
// WHY A RECORD RATHER THAN A PREDICATE. Every other #6534 family is closed by
// a shared config predicate both the builder and the renderers call, so they
// cannot disagree. These three drops cannot be: they depend on the runtime
// ifindex table, which a config-only renderer has no access to.
//
// The obvious alternative — hand the renderer the resolved ifindex map so it
// can re-derive — answers a DIFFERENT QUESTION from the one the operator
// asked. `show forwarding-options port-mirroring` asks what IS installed. A
// re-derivation against a live interface table reports what WOULD be installed
// if the builder ran again now, and an ifindex is a runtime identity that
// moves across a netdev recreate. When those two disagree the truthful answer
// is still the applied one, and the disagreement means a MISSED REBUILD — a
// bug in a different component that a re-deriving renderer would silently
// paper over. That is this issue's own failure mode reintroduced one layer up.
//
// So the builder records the verdict it actually reached, at apply time, and
// the renderer prints that.
//
// Input is empty for an instance-level drop and set for an input-level one.
// The granularity is not cosmetic: an instance whose output resolves but whose
// second input is claimed is PARTIALLY installed, and marking the whole
// instance NOT INSTALLED would lie in the other direction — the same defect
// with the sign flipped.
