//
//	set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.1.1/24
//
// alongside the fabric stanza, which manufactures an interface ROW for the
// member netdev — and userspaceRefusedNetdevs was built from rows, so that line
// is what made the netdev refusable at all. A fabric MEMBER NEEDS NO STANZA:
// delete it and the same config still runs, the netdev is still emitted into
// both sets by the fabric loops, and round 9's tally saw ZERO owners. A
// unanimity rule over an empty bucket answers "not refused", so the guard
// passed on a config it did not cover.
//
// Measured at 4cf507638 with exactly this config: `rows OWNING ge-0-0-0: 0`,
// `refusesName(ge-0-0-0) = false`, `refusesIfindex(20) = false`, ingress
// `[20 21]`, allowlist `[ge-0-0-0 ge-0-0-3]`. The refused device was in both.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore the `owners > 0` reading by dropping the fabric arm
// from buildUserspaceRefusedNetdevs, or make fabricParentUnbindable return
// false, and this reds on both sets.

// TestFabricAndBaseRowNeverDisagree pins the invariant that makes the
// unanimity rule safe now that a fabric parent votes in it (#6691 round 10).
//
// A netdev's owners are allowed to disagree — that is the round-9 rule, and a
// disagreement ADMITS the netdev, on the argument that a bindable owner will
// contribute it to the plan anyway. The argument holds only for disagreements
// production can actually produce, which are between a UNIT row and its base
// (a unit's Tunnel flag ORs the parent's; a unit-0 row resolves to the base
// netdev). A BASE row and a FABRIC parent on the same netdev must never
// disagree, because a fabric that voted "bindable" against an unbindable base
// row would break the unanimity and re-admit the device — the exact fall-through
// this round closes, arriving from the other side.
//
// The invariant is structural rather than asserted-by-convention:
// fabricParentUnbindable reads the same config fields and the SAME kernel
// sample that buildInterfaceSnapshotsFrom stamps onto the base row (see the
// hoist in buildSnapshot), so identical inputs give identical verdicts. This
// test drives it across the classes rather than trusting the reading.
//
// MATCHED BY NETDEV (#6691 round 11). This test used to pair a row with a fabric
// only when `iface.Name == fab.ParentInterface`, i.e. when the two carried the
// same AUTHORED spelling — so the one shape that actually produced a
// disagreement was invisible to it. LinuxIfName maps '/' to '-' and nothing
// else, so a member `gr-0/0/3` and a stanza `gr-0-0-3` are one device under two
// legal names, and the exact-name pairing skipped precisely that pair. The
// netdev is the identity both planes key on, so it is the identity this pairing
// uses; base rows only (a unit row sharing the base netdev is the disagreement
// production IS allowed to produce).
//
// Since round 11 a base/fabric disagreement is no longer itself a fail-open —
// the fabric abstains where a row owns the netdev (snapshotNetdevVotes) — but
// the verdict still ships on the wire and still scopes the protocol gate where
// it is ownerless, so an honest verdict is still the contract.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: give fabricParentUnbindable a different evidence source
