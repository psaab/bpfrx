// still returned ok=true with the verbatim ref for EVERY `st<N>.<unit>` that no
// VPN owned, and it is consulted FIRST by all three resolvers
// (ResolveKernelIfName, snapshotLinuxName, junosHostLinuxName). Half of a
// two-part mechanism moving is the worst outcome available: the half that moved
// is defended by tests, and the half that stayed is what ships.
//
// These pin the resolver half. Every case here has NO VPN binding the ref, so
// the honest device is whatever the ordinary resolution names — a NIC, a VLAN
// device, a GRE device — and the verbatim dotted ref names nothing at all.

// unownedStConfig compiles a config through the real parser and compiler. The
// hand-built `*config.Config` shortcut would not prove these configs COMMIT,
// which is the premise of the whole finding: nothing reserves the `st` prefix,
// so `set interfaces st5 ...` with no IPsec anywhere is an ordinary interface.
