// #7194: the Go half of the DERIVED session-open delta schema identity.
//
// The Rust half is userspace-dp/src/protocol/session_delta_schema.rs. The two
// MUST produce the same u64 for the same wire schema, and they are asserted to
// AGREE rather than either being pinned to a literal — a literal would encode
// which side is trusted, and #7457 is the case in this tree where the side
// everyone assumed correct was the broken one.
//
// Canonical form (both sides): wire names, sorted ascending as byte strings,
// joined with "\n", no trailing newline; FNV-1a/64 over those bytes.
//
// WHY DERIVED. ConfigSnapshotProtocolVersion gates the config snapshot; the
// session-delta schema had no identity at all. Five fields (#5865) and
// rt_flow_session_id (#5212 -> #6312) each drifted between the two transports
// and shipped, because there was no version to bump and nothing computed one.
// A hand-maintained integer would inherit exactly that failed discipline. This
// is computed from the struct, so adding, removing or renaming a wire field
// changes it whether or not anyone remembers.

// NOTE ON PACKAGE PLACEMENT. The wire-name EXTRACTION lives in pkg/daemon, not
// here, because it needs `reflect` and the #1476 retirement-boundary canary
// (TestUserspaceManagerDoesNotImportReflectOrUnsafe) forbids reflection in this
// package's production code — reflection is exactly how an entry-program canary
// would be bypassed. The canonicalisation and hashing below are pure functions
// over a name list, so they stay next to the wire types they describe.

// SessionDeltaSchemaCanonicalOf is the exact string the fingerprint is taken
// over: names sorted ascending as byte strings, joined with "\n", no trailing
// newline. Exposed separately from the hash so a mismatch can be DIFFED — two
// unequal u64s tell you that the schemas differ and nothing about how.
