// TestWorkerCommandQueueDropsWireKeyLockstepWithRust6929 pins the JSON key of
// ProcessStatus.WorkerCommandQueueDrops to the key userspace-dp actually emits
// (#6929).
//
// NEITHER SIDE IS PINNED TO A LITERAL, following the #6842 guard: the Rust key
// is read out of the `#[serde(rename = ...)]` attribute on the Rust field, the
// Go key out of the struct tag by reflection, and the test asserts they AGREE.
// A literal would encode which of the two spellings is trusted, and the failure
// being guarded is exactly that one plane moved and the other did not.
//
// WHY THIS COUNTER NEEDS THE GUARD MORE THAN MOST. The field is additive and
// `default`-ed on the Rust side and `omitempty` on the Go side, so a key
// mismatch never fails a decode — it reads 0 forever. For most counters 0 is a
// suspicious value; for this one 0 is the EXPECTED steady state, because the
// worker drain takes the whole deque in a single `core::mem::take` and cannot
// be outrun by a sustained producer. So a broken wire here is not merely
// silent, it is indistinguishable from the healthy case on every operator
// surface, and it stays that way precisely until the condition the counter
// exists to report — a worker that stopped draining while its producers kept
// enqueueing — actually happens.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: change the Go struct tag or the Rust rename without changing
// the other and this reds.
