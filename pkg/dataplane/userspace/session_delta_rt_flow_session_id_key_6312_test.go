// TestSessionDeltaRTFlowSessionIDWireKeyLockstepWithRust6312 pins the Go
// DECODER's JSON key for SessionDeltaInfo.RTFlowSessionID to the key the Rust
// producer actually emits.
//
// #6312 made the JSON session-delta leg carry the #5212 stable RT_FLOW session
// id, which the binary event-stream open frame had carried since #5212 while
// this leg silently dropped it. The Rust side declares the key with
// `#[serde(rename = ...)]` on `SessionDeltaInfo.rt_flow_session_id`
// (userspace-dp/src/protocol/binding.rs); this side reads it through a struct
// tag. Those are two spellings of one contract, and a mismatch is SILENT on both
// planes: the field is simply absent from the decoded struct, Go leaves it 0,
// and 0 is a legitimate value ("no id carried" — the peer allocates a fresh
// local id). That is exactly the pre-#6312 behaviour, so the fix would look
// applied and do nothing.
//
// The key is therefore parsed out of the Rust source rather than restated here:
// a constant written down twice is two constants. Reverting either side's
// spelling reds this.
