// #7754: every in-package type that embeds discardingDataPlane must DECLARE
// which pass it presents as, with its own xpfValidationPass method.
//
// The defect this closes is silent inheritance. discardingDataPlane carries
// `xpfValidationPass() -> true` — load-bearing, because
// validateBeforeMutateWithResult REJECTS a dataplane without the marker, so the
// pre-pass cannot simply drop it. Go embedding is transitive, so ANY fixture
// embedding the shim to reuse its ~30 no-op methods silently inherits "I am the
// validation pre-pass" as well.
//
// That produced a fixture (recordingDP) that ran the REAL pass while the
// compiler believed it was the discarded one, and there is no symptom: no
// error, no warning, no count discrepancy. It was harmless only because no
// recordingDP test happened to assert on anything isValidationPass gates — and
// isValidationPass gates the compiler's log emission, which is exactly the
// class #6903 is about. The next log-sensitive test written on that fixture
// would have exercised the suppressed side, passed, and proved nothing.
//
// A census rather than a type-system fix because Go offers none: embedding is
// transitive by design, and splitting the marker into its own embeddable type
// would still be inherited through discardingDataPlane. What CAN be enforced is
// that the classification is stated rather than acquired, so a reviewer reading
// a new fixture sees which pass it is without tracing an embedding chain.
