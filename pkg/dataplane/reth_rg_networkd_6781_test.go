// #6781: buildInterfaceNetworkdModels decided "is this a VRRP-backed reth
// member?" and, for an interface with NO `redundant-parent`, answered from a
// bare `RedundancyGroup > 0`. A genuine RG owner never reaches that arm — the
// skip above it keys on RethToPhysical — so the arm only ever fired on the
// broken shape: `redundant-ether-options redundancy-group` on an interface that
// is neither a reth member nor a reth owner.
//
// When it fired it REPLACED the operator's configured address with a
// 169.254.<rg>.<node>/32 link-local and set KeepConfiguration=static, handing
// the real address to VRRP as a virtual address. Under `no-reth-vrrp` the
// direct owner skipped the interface too, so the address was stripped here and
// installed by NOBODY, on both nodes.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore `isVRRPReth = ifCfg.RedundancyGroup > 0 &&
// clusterNodeID >= 0` in that else arm and this goes RED — the configured
// address disappears from the model and a 169.254.x/32 takes its place.
