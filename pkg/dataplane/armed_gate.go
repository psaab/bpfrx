// obsoleteRegistryLocked records that a lookup just served a handle from a
// SUPERSEDED registry generation (#6741). The caller must hold m.mu.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. Teardown's Cleanup destroys the pinned kernel objects but does
// not clear m.maps / m.programs, and the #2114 A3 rule deliberately lets a
// retained-state method PROCEED. So between a Teardown-retain and the next
// publish, a lookup hands back a handle to an obsolete forwarding generation and
// the caller mutates it: a mutation that succeeds and reaches nothing. Nothing
// measured that before this counter, on either recurrence path
// (bootstrap.go's enterBootstrapMode, and the standalone first-commit timeout in
// daemon_apply_commit.go).
//
// WHAT CHANGED (#6741 AC1). This used to count SERVED handles and change no
// behaviour. The lookup now REFUSES: it returns present=false so the caller
// takes its not-present path instead of mutating an orphan. The counter is the
// observability half of that guard, and counts refusals.
//
// The acceptance criterion offered "fails loudly OR is a verified no-op with a
// metric". The no-op branch was foreclosed by measurement: Close closes only
// the XDP/TC link handles and Cleanup unpins WITHOUT closing, so m.maps /
// m.programs FDs are never closed — the orphaned map stays alive and WRITABLE,
// and the mutation succeeds against a generation nothing forwards through.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER, and this must not be read as the hazard being
// closed:
//
//   - it remains a LOOKUP-TIME check. lookupMapLocked returns the *ebpf.Map by
//     reference and then RELEASES m.mu, so a handle obtained BEFORE the
//     Teardown and held across it is never re-checked and is neither refused
//     nor counted. AC1 is met for handles obtained after the boundary, not for
//     escaped ones.
//   - a mutation-time check, which would cover those, needs the generation read
//     at the syscall — and #6740 forbids holding m.mu across a BPF syscall.
//     That tension is why AC2 (a lease/refcount with drain discipline) is a
//     design item rather than an extension of this.
//
// A zero counter means "no lookup was refused", never "no obsolete mutation
// occurred".
// registryObsoleteLocked reports whether the registry is currently serving a
// generation that Teardown has superseded (#6741 AC1). The caller must hold
// m.mu.
//
// SCOPE — this is the whole safety argument for refusing. `registryObsoleteFrom`
// is set by `Teardown` and explicitly NOT by `Close`: Close keeps its pinned
// handles live for hitless restart, and the #2114 A3 proceed-on-retained rule
// is argued for exactly that case. So a Close-then-reuse sequence never sees
// this predicate true and proceeds precisely as before. What is refused is only
// the Teardown window, where `Cleanup` has already unpinned the objects and the
// retained handles are ORPHANS of a generation nothing forwards through.
//
