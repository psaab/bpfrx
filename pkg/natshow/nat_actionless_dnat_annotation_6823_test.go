// nat_actionless_dnat_annotation_6823_test.go — #6823.
//
// #6823 decided the contract for a leniently-admitted ACTIONLESS NAT rule: it
// is NON-TERMINAL, so matching traffic falls THROUGH to whatever rule follows.
// The decision is only as good as what the operator is told, and #7640's
// annotation told the two kinds different things.
//
// The source arm named the consequence ("does NOT stop rule evaluation, so
// matching traffic falls through to any later broader rule"). The destination
// arm named only the mechanism — "the rule is not published to the dataplane
// at all" — which is TRUE and reads as INERT. That is the precise framing the
// #5717 / #6820 line of work exists to retire: the rule being absent is exactly
// WHY evaluation continues, so an operator who wrote a DNAT rule believing it
// exempts a host is told the reassuring half of a sentence whose other half is
// that the host is translated by the next broader rule.
//
// TestLenientlyAdmittedSourceRuleIsAnnotated7640 cannot see this: it renders
// the SOURCE detail only, so the destination arm of the same switch was
// unbound.
