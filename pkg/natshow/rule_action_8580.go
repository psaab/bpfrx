// rule_action_8580.go — #8580.
//
// THE DRIFT. Five surfaces render a source-NAT rule's action, and each computed
// it from its own copy of the same switch. Measured before this file existed,
// counting reads of `Then.Off` per file:
//
//	pkg/natshow/source.go        1
//	pkg/cli/cli_show_nat.go      0   (3 bare `action := "interface"`)
//	pkg/api/nat.go               0   (1)
//	pkg/grpcapi/server_nat.go    0   (1)
//
// So #7640 — "render the action the rule ACTUALLY carries", which stopped an
// ACTIONLESS rule from claiming an action it does not have and will not
// perform — landed in ONE copy and left the other four wrong. Every other
// surface still reported `then source-nat off` (a no-NAT exemption, #3844) as
// `interface`, i.e. as the exact opposite of what the rule does: exempt from
// NAT, rendered as NAT'ing via the egress interface.
//
// #7363 has the identical shape one field over: `natMatchAddresses` is read 3
// times in `pkg/natshow` and 0 times anywhere else, so a rule scoped by an
// address-book NAME renders as `0.0.0.0/0` — matching everything — on every
// surface but one.
//
// WHY THIS IS SINGLE-SOURCED RATHER THAN CROSS-CHECKED. An agreement test
// between five copies asserts they say the same thing; it does not stop a sixth
// copy being written, and it must pick a spelling to compare against, which
// encodes which copy is trusted. Routing every surface through one function
// removes the class: there is nothing left to disagree.
//
// The strings are deliberately identical across CLI, REST and gRPC. They were
// already meant to be — each copy was a transcription of the same four cases —
// and an operator who greps a REST response for the action their CLI showed
// should find it.

// SourceRuleAction renders a source-NAT rule's action exactly as
// `show security nat source rule detail` does.
//
// The `none` case is load-bearing and is NOT a placeholder for "interface":
// a rule with no `then` at all is rejected by the strict commit gate but is
// admitted by a tolerant load (#1960), and it performs no translation. Naming
// it `interface` tells the operator the one rule shape they most need to find
// is doing something it is not (#7640).

// RuleMatchSource renders a rule's complete source-address match, or the
// caller-visible "any" spelling when it has none. See match_addresses_7363.go
// for why the plural supersedes the singular rather than joining it.
//
// Named for the SIDE, not the rule kind: source-NAT and destination-NAT rules
// carry the same `Match` field set, so the destination-NAT renderers use these
// too. That matters because the singular-only copy had spread to BOTH kinds —
// the census in this package's test found three destination-side copies after
// the source side was routed through here.
