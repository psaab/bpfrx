// #6656: node0 reported PRIMARY for every RG while node1 carried the whole
// dataplane (1 vs 33 sessions, 4.7K vs 4.6M rx packets), with traffic flowing
// throughout.
//
// THE REPORTER'S HYPOTHESIS IS INAPPLICABLE, and saying so matters more than
// the fix. It proposed a VRRP virtual-MAC / VIP disagreement — but
// `private-rg-election` is the COMPILER DEFAULT (compiler_system.go: it is set
// true unconditionally and only `no-private-rg-election` opts out), and the
// loss userspace cluster's config does not opt out. Under it
// `vrrp.CollectRethInstances` returns nil, so there are no RETH VRRP instances
// at all: no VIP-owning state machine to disagree with, no sync hold, no
// preempt gate. An inapplicable hypothesis left standing sends the next
// investigator down the same path.
//
// WHAT DOES PRODUCE THAT SIGNATURE is peerTransferOutOverride outliving the
// peer incarnation it was granted against:
//
//   - `request chassis cluster failover redundancy-group N node 0` arms it,
//     rewriting THIS node's view of the peer to StateSecondaryHold.
//   - It has NO expiry, and applyTransferCommitOverridesOnPeerStateLocked
//     re-applies it to the rebuilt peer-group map on EVERY heartbeat.
//   - electRG then takes its "Peer transfer out" arm and self-elects this node
//     primary regardless of what the peer actually reports.
//   - FormatStatus renders the POST-override m.peerGroups, so the operator sees
//     a healthy primary — with an empty session table — and the peer shown as
//     secondary while the peer believes otherwise.
//
// handlePeerTimeout cleared ManualFailover ("the peer is dead, so the surviving
// node MUST be able to take over"), peerGroups, peerMonitors and both peer
// version fields — but not this. So the authority survived the peer that
// granted it, and cluster-setup.sh's reassert_primary_node0 arms it for EVERY
// RG on node0 after EVERY rolling deploy, swallowing errors. Two rolling
// deploys and a reboot preceded the incident.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: delete the clearPeerTransferOutOverrideLocked loop from
// handlePeerTimeout and both tests below go RED.
