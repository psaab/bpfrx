// #7257 — StartHeartbeat published m.hbSender/m.hbReceiver under m.mu, RELEASED
// the lock, and then dereferenced the fields it had just written:
//
//	m.mu.Unlock()
//	m.hbReceiver.start()   // unlocked read
//	m.hbSender.start()     // unlocked read
//
// while StopHeartbeat nils both under the lock. Two outcomes, both live:
//
//  1. nil-deref panic, if the stop lands in that gap;
//  2. a sender/receiver pair started AFTER a stop already captured and nilled
//     the handles — running with nothing able to stop it, on a torn-down
//     cluster. That one is worse than the panic: it is silent.
//
// Reachable because startHeartbeatWithRetry runs on a bare `go` goroutine that
// is NOT in clusterCommsWG (unlike the sync constructor), so stopClusterComms
// never joins it — it only cancels the context and calls StopHeartbeat.
//
// CI has no path to it: make test-go's race gate (test-race-dp) runs -race
// under a fixed -run filter and nothing in that set drives startClusterComms
// with a control-link endpoint, so the heartbeat path is never raced.

// TestStartHeartbeatDoesNotRaceStopHeartbeat7257 is the race probe.
//
// WARNING (#7663): this probe currently observes NOTHING, and the change below
// does not fix that — it only stops the degeneracy floor firing spuriously
// under load (#7650). Measured at de6b8c85d on an idle machine, with the #7257
// production fix reverted, `-race` reports ZERO data races, both with and
// without the #7650 change. That contract was false as written; it is now
// stated below as the measured RATE it actually is, with its run counts.
//
// The cause is structural, not timing: StartHeartbeat re-checks its entry epoch
// before publishing, StopHeartbeat bumps that epoch, and this probe runs an
// UNBOUNDED teardown loop. Instrumenting the epoch check gives
// `publish-window entered=0 superseded=60` against 39300 stops — every start is
// superseded long before it reaches the derefs that carry the race. The
// `stops >= starts` floor below is satisfied by exactly the condition that
// guarantees the vacuity, so it cannot detect it.
//
// #7663 carries the fix (pace the teardown; assert the publish window was
// entered). Do not read a green here as evidence the #7257 regression is
// guarded.
//
// The BOUNDED side is the expensive one. StartHeartbeat creates two UDP
// sockets; StopHeartbeat is nearly free. A first draft bounded the stops and
// looped the starts "until done", and the logged rate gave it away immediately:
// 1 start against 200 stops — the cheap loop ran to completion inside the
// expensive loop's first pass, so the window was raced approximately once.
// Bounding the starts and looping the stops until they signal done is what
// makes every start contend.
//
// The count is logged rather than assumed, so a future change that makes
// StartHeartbeat slower turns a degenerate probe into a visible one instead of
// a quiet pass.
//
// The assertion is the race detector, so this is only meaningful under -race.
//
// RED ON REVERT (#7663) — a measured RATE, deliberately not stated as a
// contract. The exact revert, in StartHeartbeat — written as before/after
// rather than as a unified diff, because gofmt reformats a leading `-`/`+`
// inside an indented comment into a godoc list and rewrites `+` to `-`, which
// would silently turn the additions below into deletions and make this
// instruction wrong:
//
//	BEFORE (fixed, as shipped):     AFTER (reverted, reproduces the race):
//	    receiver.start()                m.mu.Unlock()
//	    sender.start()                  m.hbReceiver.start()
//	    m.mu.Unlock()                   m.hbSender.start()
//
// Both halves matter: the start() calls move AFTER the Unlock, AND they read
// the FIELDS rather than the locals. That unlocked read of fields StopHeartbeat
// nils under the lock is #7257's actual defect. Disarming the `m.hbEpoch !=
// startEpoch` supersede guard instead does NOT reproduce it — that leaves the
// publish and both start() calls inside the critical section, so there is no
// unsynchronised access for the detector to find. (Recorded because a reviewer
// read "restore the unlocked pair" that way, reasonably, and measured 0 races.)
//
// With that revert applied, `go test -race -run
// TestStartHeartbeatDoesNotRaceStopHeartbeat7257 ./pkg/cluster/` reported
// WARNING: DATA RACE naming StartHeartbeat and StopHeartbeat in:
//
//	12 of 12 runs at startAttempts = 240   (this file)
//	10 of 12 runs at startAttempts = 60    (the previous value)
//
// It is a rate and not a guarantee, and 12/12 does not upgrade it to one — the
// misses are governed by REACH, and a run whose contention happens to collapse
// reach (one miss logged `4 published / 56 superseded`) has fewer chances to
// catch it. Before #7663 the rate was 0 of N: the probe could not distinguish a
// fixed tree from a reverted one at all.
// waitForTeardownProgress blocks until the teardown goroutine has completed at
// least one stop, so the start loop is issued into a window that is provably
// being contended (#7650).
//
// Only ONE edge, and only before the contended region. A per-start handshake
// would be deterministic but would also establish happens-before between each
// teardown and the start it races, which is exactly what the race detector
// looks for the absence of — the probe would go quiet against the very bug it
// exists to catch.
// teardownProgressBudget bounds the wait for the teardown goroutine's first
// stop. It is deliberately generous, and 5s was not.
//
// #7679: at 5s this test made master RED under `go test ./...` — twice. The
// bound is not a timing assertion about the heartbeat code; its only job is to
// turn "the goroutine was never scheduled at all" into a named failure instead
// of a silent degenerate probe or a hang. Under `./...` the runner starts many
// package binaries concurrently, each with GOMAXPROCS equal to the core count,
// so the machine is heavily oversubscribed and a cheap goroutine can wait a
// long time for a P.
//
// #7970 CORRECTION. The sentence that stood here — "raising it costs nothing…
// a goroutine that is genuinely never scheduled stays unscheduled for 30s just
// as surely as for 5s" — is FALSE, and it was the sentence that would have sent
// the next person to raise the bound a third time. The test then red at exactly
// 30.00s under `go test ./...`, so the goroutine was not "genuinely never
// scheduled": the bound was a wall-clock sample after all, just a later one.
//
// The cause was not the machine. It was THIS TEST. The teardown loop used to
// spin with no pacing, burning ~73k stop iterations per run; under `./...` the
// runner already oversubscribes every core, so the probe was both the
// contributor to and the victim of the contention it then waited 30s on. It
// starved itself. #7663's vacuity and #7970's flake were one knob seen from two
// ends, and pacing the loop (see the teardown goroutine) removed both.
//
// The bound is kept at 30s and is NOT a timing assertion: its only job is to
// turn a hang into a named failure. It is deliberately left generous rather than
// lowered to match the now-much-lower contention, because lowering it would be a
// fresh unmeasured claim about scheduling latency — the exact kind of claim this
// comment previously got wrong.
// startCostMicros is the measured cost of one `StartHeartbeat` on this path,
// in microseconds, and it is what the teardown pacing is scaled against.
//
// Measured rather than guessed (#7663): 60 uncontended starts averaged 60.95us
// each (two socket binds dominate) against 226ns for a stop — a ratio of ~270.
// That ratio IS the vacuity: an unpaced teardown loop lands ~270 stops inside
// every start's entry-to-epoch-recheck window, so every start is superseded.
//
// It does not need to be exact. It sets the ORDER OF MAGNITUDE of the gap the
// teardown leaves, and the randomisation spans it; being wrong by 2x changes
// how often starts publish, not whether they can.
const startCostMicros = 61

// measureStartCost is what actually paces the teardown loop, and it exists
// because `startCostMicros` above is calibrated on an IDLE box (#8207/#8345).
//
// The const's own comment reasons that "being wrong by 2x changes how often
// starts publish, not whether they can". That is true at 2x and false at the
// factor a full `go test ./...` run produces. Under oversubscription a start
// costs far more than 61us — two socket binds while several times the core
// count of goroutines compete — while the teardown's sleep stays pinned to
// 61us, so the stop:start ratio climbs back toward the unpaced regime and every
// start is superseded again. That is exactly the failure both issues report:
// `240 of 240 starts were SUPERSEDED before publishing`, on a machine where the
// probe passes 8/8 in isolation.
//
// Raising the const would be widening a margin against an unbounded quantity.
// Measuring it removes the assumption instead: if the box is 10x slower, the
// observed cost is 10x larger, the gap the teardown leaves grows with it, and
// the publish rate is preserved. The probe becomes scale-invariant rather than
// calibrated.
//
// The calibration is UNCONTENDED on purpose — it runs before the two goroutines
// start — so it measures the cost of a start on this machine right now, which
// is the quantity the pacing needs. It is not a happens-before edge with
// anything in the contended phase and cannot order the race the probe detects.

			//     have: a larger bound only buys a longer wait for an event
			//     that will never arrive;
			//   - it passed in 0.010s in isolation, because on an idle box this
			//     goroutine wins the first-schedule race trivially;
			//   - it SURVIVED the #7663 pacing fix, because pacing changes how

			// #7970: the `done` check is at the END, so this goroutine always

			// It used to be at the TOP, and that is the whole of #7970. `done`
			// is closed by the start goroutine's `defer` once its 60 starts are
