// Epoch ADMISSION: the #6169 boot-epoch gate and the per-value session budget
// that bounds it.
//
// Split out of heartbeat.go in #6669 r18. heartbeat.go carries the wire format
// and the sender/receiver lifecycle; this file carries the decision an
// authenticated frame's epoch is put through, which is a distinct concern with
// its own (long) rationale. The split was forced by the 2000-line modularity
// gate when the finding-2 disclosure widened, and it is the right cut
// regardless: nothing here touches sockets.

// admitAuthed is the #6169 anti-replay decision for one MAC-VERIFIED frame:
// the boot-epoch floor and the bounded session ring applied as ONE transaction
// under the state lock. Callers must invoke it only after the MAC has verified.
//
// hasEpoch reports whether the frame carried a boot-epoch section
// (heartbeatFrameEpoch).
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The epoch floor is tested BEFORE the session ring is
// consulted, and a frame rejected by the floor never reaches ring.admit. Test
// it after, and the gate is bypassable: ring.admit RECORDS a never-seen session
// as a side effect, so a replayed retired frame would still evict a live
// watermark and churn the ring even while being rejected. That inverted
// ordering is what failed review on the earlier attempt (#6370).
//
// The three cases:
//
//   - epoch < highEpoch — an incarnation OLDER than the highest one accepted.
//     Reject. This is the #6169 close: a captured frame below the floor never
//     reaches the ring at all, so it cannot churn it.
//     "Older" is not the same as "retired", and the difference is #6711: once a
//     sender's epoch has REGRESSED, the live incarnation is the one sorted
//     below, so this branch refuses it while an archived frame from a genuinely
//     retired one is admitted above.
//   - epoch == highEpoch — an incarnation at the floor. Fall through to the
//     ring, which is what handles within-incarnation replay (unchanged #6167
//     behaviour) — but only for a BOUNDED set of sessions at that value
//     (heartbeatEpochSessionsPerEpoch slots, reset by a raise).
//     Equality MUST fall through for a bound session: the live peer signs
//     every frame of its incarnation with one epoch, so rejecting equality
//     outright would declare a healthy peer dead. It must NOT fall through
//     without a bound: distinct sessions sharing one epoch churn the ring
//     exactly as epochless frames do (measured 1625/1625). And the bound
//     cannot be ONE — a successor incarnation republishes its predecessor's
//     epoch whenever the store cannot advance the file, so a singleton refused
//     a healthy node on every heartbeat (measured 0/40). See
//     highEpochSessions for both measurements and the residual.
//     A regressed sender therefore has two doors out of a poisoned floor:
//     landing exactly ON it while a slot is free, or RAISING past it. Strictly
//     past is the wider (a nanosecond of wall clock, versus hitting one value
//     exactly) and the only one that cannot be exhausted; an earlier revision
//     of this comment named equality alone, and round 10 shut it entirely.
//     TestPoisonedFloorStillRecoversByRaise_6669 measures both.
//   - epoch > highEpoch — an incarnation newer than anything accepted so far
//     (genuinely newer while the sender's clock advances; #6711 is when it is
//     merely a higher reading from an older one). Let the ring vet the
//     nonce, then raise the floor. The floor only ever rises to a value the
//     genuine peer actually signed — but that does NOT mean it cannot rise
//     above the live peer, and an earlier revision of this comment said it did.
//     It rises above the LIVE peer whenever the peer's own epoch has REGRESSED
//     since the archived frame was signed (#6711: a backward clock step larger
//     than bootEpochMaxSkew makes refineBootEpoch decline the intact persisted
//     value and durably overwrite it with the lower one). One archived frame
//     then locks the live peer out, and because the archived frame re-raises a
//     CLEARED floor exactly as it re-arms a cleared latch, a receiver restart
//     does not recover while it is being replayed. Measured in
//     TestArchivedEpochPoisonsAFreshFloor_6711.
//
// MIGRATION + THE DOWNGRADE LATCH (dual-accept, the #4126 VRRP-checksum /
// heartbeatAuthDecision pattern).
//
// An epochless frame is accepted and passed to the ring exactly as before —
// UNTIL the peer has proved it emits epochs. From then on an epochless frame
// from that peer is refused. Both halves are required:
//
//   - Accepting epochless frames before the peer has proved otherwise is what
//     keeps a rolling upgrade from splitting the cluster, and it is why the
//     latch is armed by OBSERVATION rather than by local build version.
//   - Refusing them afterwards is what actually closes #6169. An attacker's
//     captures are by construction mostly PRE-upgrade and therefore epochless;
//     without the latch they bypass the floor entirely and the fix would only
//     defend against an attacker who started capturing after the upgrade.
//     Measured on the first cut of this change: floor latched at a live peer's
//     epoch, and still 975/975 epochless replays admitted.
//
// The latch is armed by an ACCEPTED frame that carried an epoch section, and it
// is PROCESS-scoped: it lives on Manager.hbAuth, so the routine restarts
// (heartbeat restart, DHCP-triggered VRF rebind, HA comms restart) preserve it
// and only a full daemon restart clears it. See the epochSeen field comment for
// why a durable latch was priced and removed.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE LATCH SAFE is the sender-side invariant in heartbeat_epoch.go:
// a keyed heartbeat carries no epoch IF AND ONLY IF the peer runs a pre-#6169
// build.
//
// That invariant holds against BOTH storage failure modes, and the distinction
// is load-bearing because only one of them was ever covered. A FAILING store
// (unwritable dir, ENOSPC, corrupt file) always fell through to the wall-clock
// seed. A HANGING store did not: the epoch was computed before any I/O and then
// thrown away by not publishing until after a blocking LOCK_EX, so a held lock
// left bootEpoch at 0 and the sender silently degraded to a legacy frame — which
// a latched peer then rejects, declaring a healthy node dead within ~500ms
// (measured). Emission is now published from the wall clock BEFORE any file is
// touched (Manager.heartbeatBootEpoch), so a hung disk, a blocking flock and a
// wedged fsync are all survivable; persistence only ever raises the value later.
//
// The one remaining trigger is a genuine ROLLBACK of the peer to a pre-#6169
// build, a deliberate operator-initiated act: that peer's frames are refused
// until the latch is cleared. There is no state file to hand-edit. This is the
// same trade #4107's sticky peerAuthSeen already makes for the auth trailer.
//
// `systemctl restart xpfd` on THIS node clears the latch, but it is NOT
// sufficient on its own: an attacker holding one archived epoch-bearing frame
// re-arms it against the empty post-restart state. Rotate the control-link PSK
// on both nodes FIRST, then restart. See the arming site in admitAuthed
// for why, and why it is not closed in code.
//
// The three epoch cases, once the peer is known to emit them:
//
//   - epoch < highEpoch — an incarnation OLDER than the highest one accepted.
//     Reject. This is the #6169 close: a captured frame below the floor never
//     reaches the ring at all, so it cannot churn it.
//     "Older" is not the same as "retired", and the difference is #6711: once a
//     sender's epoch has REGRESSED, the live incarnation is the one sorted
//     below, so this branch refuses it while an archived frame from a genuinely
//     retired one is admitted above.
//   - epoch == highEpoch — an incarnation at the floor. Fall through to the
//     ring, which is what handles within-incarnation replay (unchanged #6167
//     behaviour) — but only for a BOUNDED set of sessions at that value
//     (heartbeatEpochSessionsPerEpoch slots, reset by a raise).
//     Equality MUST fall through for a bound session: the live peer signs
//     every frame of its incarnation with one epoch, so rejecting equality

//
// An epoch outside the ABSOLUTE plausibility band (epochUsableAsFloor: zero, or
// beyond year 2200) is REFUSED. That check is clock-independent, so it is safe
// on every frame and runs before anything else in the hasEpoch path: such a
// frame never reaches the floor comparison, never touches the ring, and never
// arms the latch — s.epochSeen stays false. A corrupt far-future value
// therefore cannot slam the one-way door.
//
// The FORWARD bound (epochWithinForwardBound: more than bootEpochMaxSkew — one
// HOUR — ahead of our own wall clock) is deliberately NOT tested here. It gates
// only the RAISE path, epoch > highEpoch, where latching a far-future floor is
// the actual hazard.
//
// DO NOT HOIST THE FORWARD BOUND BACK TO THE TOP. Re-testing an epoch that has
// ALREADY been accepted is a different thing from vetting a new one, and doing
// it was a defect: a backward wall-clock step beyond the skew made every
// subsequent frame from a healthy, already-latched incarnation fail the bound
// and be rejected BEFORE the monotonic lastSeen update, so the peer was
// declared dead in ~500ms and the cluster went dual-master. At epoch ==
// highEpoch the frame therefore falls through to the ring (for a session within
// the per-value bound — see highEpochSessions), which is correct: equality
// cannot move the floor, so the one-way door is untouched either way.
//
// The second-order consequence is the safe direction and is deliberate: a peer
// whose clock runs more than an hour ahead cannot RAISE the floor, and because
// the latch never armed on it, its EPOCHLESS frames would still be accepted if
// it were later rolled back. Refusing to latch an out-of-bound epoch never
// strands a peer that comes back into range.
// It returns the admission decision and, on refusal, a REASON naming the arm
// that refused. The reason exists because heartbeatAuthDecision cannot tell
// them apart: it sees only `nonceFresh == false` and reports every one of them
// as "stale nonce (replay)". Two of the epoch arms are not replays at all — an
// out-of-band epoch is a corrupt or non-conforming peer, and an epoch past the
// forward bound is a healthy peer with a fast clock — and labelling either as a
// replay sends the operator hunting an attacker instead of checking the peer's
// build or its NTP. An empty reason means "no epoch-specific arm refused this",
// and the caller keeps heartbeatAuthDecision's generic wording.
//
// It takes s.mu itself. It was previously a bare pass-through to a second
// method named admitAuthed, which by the usual Go convention would mean

	// ARMING THE LATCH. A REPLAY CAN DO THIS, and the consequence is a real

	//
	// Arming requires only an authenticated, orderable, ring-fresh epoch frame.
	// Against a FRESH state — which is exactly what the documented rollback
	// recovery (restart xpfd) produces, since highEpoch, this latch and the ring
	// are all process-scoped — a single ARCHIVED frame captured while the peer
	// still ran an epoch-capable build satisfies all three: highEpoch is 0 so
	// nothing is below the floor, and an empty ring calls its session
	// never-seen. It re-arms the latch, and the legitimately rolled-back peer's
	// genuine epochless frames are refused again at the top of this function.
	// One replay per restart sustains that indefinitely.
	//
	// SO RESTARTING xpfd IS NOT, BY ITSELF, RELIABLE RECOVERY FROM A ROLLBACK
	// while an on-link attacker holds such a capture — which is precisely the
	// attacker #6169 exists to defend against. The complete recovery is to
	// ROTATE THE CONTROL-LINK PSK on both nodes FIRST and restart xpfd after:
	// rotation makes every archived frame fail verifyHeartbeatMAC, so it never
	// reaches this function to re-arm anything. Order matters — restart first
	// and the replay can land in the window before the new key is committed.
	// The key is re-read per frame on both paths, so rotation needs no restart
	// of its own.
	//
	// This is NOT closed in code, and the alternatives were priced separately,
	// because they are separate designs. A durable FLOOR re-creates the
	// peer-floor state file this design deliberately removed and makes an
	// in-range-but-wrong epoch a lockout that outlives reboots. A durable
	// PSK-scoped LATCH avoids both of those, and is declined for its own
	// reasons — a durable write on the accept path with no good failure policy,
	// cross-process locking there, and a strictly heavier procedure for the
	// no-attacker rollback. It is NOT declined as redundant with the mandatory
	// post-upgrade PSK rotation, which an earlier revision of this comment
	// claimed: a rotation retires captures taken BEFORE it and nothing else, and
	// a durable latch refuses epoch-less captures taken under the CURRENT key,
	// which are the ones that sustain forged liveness indefinitely (measured
	// 1625/1625 admitted after a restart, against 0/1625 for a spent
	// epoch-bearing set). Both are priced in full at the epochSeen field comment.
	// Binding arming to freshness needs a challenge-response or a timestamp the
	// heartbeat wire format does not carry, and cannot be approximated from the
	// epoch itself: a legitimately long-lived peer's epoch is arbitrarily old,
	// so no recency test separates it from an archived one.
	//
	// SCOPE, honestly: a peer that has NEVER emitted an epoch cannot be falsely
	// armed this way — there is nothing to capture. It bites on rollback,
	// replacement under the same identity and key, or a partial upgrade.
	//
	// AND THE COST IS NOT ONLY THE LATCH (#6669 r18, Codex finding 2). The
	// same archived frame is ADMITTED, so admitFrame goes on to refresh
	// lastSeen and call handlePeerHeartbeat: a peer that is DEAD looks alive
	// for as long as the replay continues, and that liveness feeds election.
	// One frame per dead-peer interval sustains it. This is NOT introduced
	// here — master has no epoch gate at all, so the bare ring admits the
	// same frame after the same restart, and TestHeartbeatRestartStillAccepts
	// GenuinePeer_5086 requires it (a real peer reboot must be accepted).
	// The epoch floor strictly improves on that ONCE ARMED and does not close
	// the post-restart window. Read the paragraph above as covering the latch
	// only; the forged-liveness half is the same replay, and the same PSK
