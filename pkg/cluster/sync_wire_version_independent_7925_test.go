// #7925: SessionSyncWireVersion must be its OWN counter, not derived from
// CurrentHAProtocolVersion.
//
// WHY A SOURCE-LEVEL CHECK AND NOT A VALUE COMPARISON. Both constants are 1
// today, and they were equal before this change too — when SessionSyncWireVersion
// was literally `uint16(CurrentHAProtocolVersion)`. So `SessionSyncWireVersion ==
// 1` and `SessionSyncWireVersion == CurrentHAProtocolVersion` are BOTH true
// before and after the split. No comparison of values can tell the two states
// apart; the only observable difference is whether the declaration still names
// the HA constant. That is a fact about the source, so the source is what gets
// asserted.
//
// WHY go/parser AND NOT grep. The doc comment on the declaration deliberately
// quotes the old form — "no longer `uint16(CurrentHAProtocolVersion)`" — to
// record what changed. A textual scan is therefore satisfied by the very comment
// explaining the fix, and would report the constant as still derived. Parsing to
// an AST and inspecting only the VALUE EXPRESSION excludes comments by
// construction rather than by a strip step that could itself be wrong.
//
// Bump rule this guards, from the declaration's own doc: bump
// SessionSyncWireVersion when the `syncMsg*` set or `syncHeader` changes; bump
// CurrentHAProtocolVersion when heartbeat / failover / RG-handoff semantics
// change. Their equality today is a coincidence of history, not an invariant.

// haProtocolIdentsIn reports which HA-protocol constant names appear in an
// expression. Shared by the assertion and its positive control so the control
// exercises the same walker the assertion relies on.
