// There are TWO of them because the daemon sets this ONE flag for two
// materially different reasons, and the operator's next action differs between
// them. A single string would be a false statement in one of the two cases:
//
//   - Candidate: a candidate kernel is genuinely ARMED. The hold releases when
//     the durable promotion marker confirms the running kernel. Nothing to do
//     but wait for the promotion gate.
//   - UnreadableJournal: the #5682 fail-closed hold. IsArmed returned an ERROR
//     — the journal exists but cannot be read or parsed — so the daemon could
//     not establish whether anything is armed and held fail-closed. There may
//     be no candidate at all. The operator's action is to fix /var/lib/xpf, not
//     to wait for a promotion that may never come.
//
// Telling an operator "held until the promotion marker confirms the running
// kernel" on a fail-closed hold asserts a candidate exists and that a marker
// will resolve it, both of which may be false. That is the same class of defect
// as the invisibility this issue is about, one layer in.
//
// These live HERE, next to the flag they explain, rather than in pkg/upgrade:
// pkg/cluster owns the hold (the flag, the election gate, the status
// annotation), pkg/upgrade only records what was armed. The daemon carries the
// active one across when it assembles the kernel-upgrade status, so `show
// chassis cluster status` and `show system kernel-upgrade` render one string.
