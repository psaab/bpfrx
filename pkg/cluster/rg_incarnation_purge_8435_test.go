// #8435: an RG's incarnation boundary must purge EVERY per-RG authority map.
//
// `UpdateConfig`'s removal loop purged holdTimer, degradedTimer,
// monitorWeights, garpCounts and groups — but not peerTransferOutOverride. A
// stale override survived an RG being removed and re-added under the same id,
// and the subject then SELF-PROMOTED TO PRIMARY. Reproduced at master, with a
// control (identical remove + re-add without the override stays secondary)
// that makes it a defect rather than an observation.
//
// THIS IS THE FOURTH OF THESE. The loop's own comment calls garpCounts "the
// third same-id-re-add map-lifecycle gap in this loop after #5990", so #5990
// and #6027 are the first two. Both added a map to the loop and a test naming
// that map — and a cell naming three maps cannot see the fourth. That is
// exactly how this one survived them.
//
// So the guard here does not name maps. It ENUMERATES THEM FROM THE STRUCT by
// reflection, and fails on any RG-keyed map the removal loop leaves populated.
// A fifth map added to Manager is covered on the next run whether or not
// anyone remembers this file exists.

// rgKeyedMapFields returns every Manager field that is a map keyed by
// redundancy-group id, as (fieldName, keyForRG) pairs.
//
// Two key shapes are recognised: a bare `int` id, and a struct carrying an
// `rgID` field (monitorKey). Anything else is NOT silently skipped — the
// caller fails on it. A map shape this cannot classify is a map this guard
// cannot check, and skipping it quietly would reproduce the exact failure the
// file exists to prevent: a per-RG map nobody noticed was unpurged.
