// #6669 fold — what the documented rollback recovery actually recovers from.
//
// pkg/cluster/README.md told operators that `systemctl restart xpfd` on the
// refusing node recovers from a peer rollback, unqualified. It does not, and
// the gap matters precisely against the attacker #6169 exists to stop.

// TestArchivedEpochReplayReArmsLatchAfterRestart_6169 is the executable
// statement of residual 5.
//
// The restart clears the floor, the latch and the ring TOGETHER, and arming the
// latch needs only an authenticated, orderable, ring-fresh epoch frame. Against
// that empty state a single ARCHIVED frame — captured while the peer still ran
// an epoch-capable build — satisfies all three: highEpoch is 0 so nothing is
// below the floor, and an empty ring calls its session never-seen. It re-arms
// the latch and the legitimately rolled-back peer is refused again.
//
// This is a CHARACTERIZATION test: it pins behaviour the code deliberately does
// not change (see the arming site in admitAuthed for why a durable latch
// and a freshness test were both rejected), so that the documentation and the
// operator warning cannot drift back to claiming a bare restart is enough.

// rotation retires the attacker's PRE-ROTATION archive (those frames fail
// verifyHeartbeatMAC under the new key) but does NOT clear the in-memory latch;
// a restart clears the latch but does NOT retire the archive. So the order is
// the whole content of the advice, and a test that asserts one ordering in a
// comment while executing the other proves neither.
//
// WHAT RECOVERY DOES NOT COVER is asserted too, in the first subtest. Rotation
// retires captures taken BEFORE it and nothing else, so the epoch-less frames
// the attacker records from the rolled-back peer AFTER the rotation still verify
// under the new key — and against the cleared latch the restart produces, they
// are admitted. An earlier revision of this test generated exactly those frames,
// used them only to prove that rotation alone does not recover, and then threw
// them away before the restart, which is the step that makes them usable. That
// left "there is nothing left to re-arm it" reading as though the recovery were
// complete. It is not; see TestRotationDoesNotRetirePostRotationCaptures_6669
// for the same property stated as the reason a durable latch has real value, and
// the epochSeen field comment for why it is nonetheless declined.
