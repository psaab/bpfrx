// Pre-auth connection admission for the session-sync accept path (#5303).
//
// #4370 made the accept loop spawn a per-connection setup goroutine so a slow
// handshake on ONE connection can no longer stall accepting the NEXT. That fix
// is preserved. Its residual, closed here, is that there was NO aggregate cap
// on how many connections could be in pre-auth setup at once: a host reachable
// on the sync/control network could open connections at rate R and stall each
// before authentication. Each stalled connection held a tracked goroutine, a
// 256 KiB read+write buffered socket (configureSessionSyncConn ran BEFORE the
// handshake), and an FD until its handshake deadline — steady-state ~3*R
// in-flight until FDs/goroutines/socket-memory exhausted and a LEGITIMATE peer
// could no longer reconnect (and Stop waited on every stalled setup goroutine).
// The HMAC handshake (sync_auth.go) stops a flooder from becoming the active
// peer, but it runs AFTER the buffers are sized, so it does not bound the
// resource cost of the flood.
//
// The gate has three parts, all cheap and all preserving the #4107 handshake
// and the #4370 parallel accept:
//
//  1. A small admission cap on inbound pre-auth setups (preAuthSetupCap), with
//     a reserved tail (preAuthPeerReserve) that only the configured peer's
//     address may consume — so a flood from any other source can never deny the
//     peer a reconnect slot (the DoS-denies-reconnect property). Excess
//     connections are closed immediately and bump a rate-limited counter.
//  2. Deferral of the large socket-buffer sizing until AFTER the handshake
//     succeeds (handleNewConnection), so pre-auth sockets stay cheap.
//  3. Tracking of every in-flight setup connection so Stop() can close them and
//     unblock a stalled handshake instead of hanging on the shutdown budget.
