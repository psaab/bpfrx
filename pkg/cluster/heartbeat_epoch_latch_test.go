// #6169 — the DOWNGRADE LATCH.
//
// The boot-epoch floor only ever sees frames that CARRY an epoch. An attacker's
// captured incarnations are, by construction, mostly from BEFORE the upgrade
// and therefore carry none, so a receiver that accepts epochless frames forever
// never consults the floor at all. Measured on the first cut of this change,
// with the floor latched at a live peer's epoch: 975/975 epochless replays
// admitted.
//
// The latch closes that: once the peer has proved it emits epochs, an epochless
// frame from it is refused. It is PROCESS-scoped: the routine restarts preserve
// it and only a full daemon restart clears it, after which a live peer re-arms
// it with its next heartbeat.

// heldEpochLock takes the REAL advisory lock the persist path needs, for tests
// that wedge the store rather than simulating a wedge, and returns a
// once-guarded release.
//
// EVERY CALLER PAIRS IT WITH A CLEANUP that releases AND drains, because the
// body's own release is on the happy path only: t.Fatalf runs runtime.Goexit
// and skips the rest of the body, so an assertion firing while the lock is held
// would otherwise leave a refine worker parked on it for the whole remaining
// package run — where it goes on to read the package-var seams a later test
// assigns, which is the cross-test race awaitFirstRefine exists to stop. The
// pair must be one cleanup and in that order: t.Cleanup is LIFO, so a
// separately registered drain would run BEFORE the release and simply wait out
// its budget.

//   - "declining costs a lockout that any restart on either node clears"
//     (heartbeat_epoch_test.go's chaining rationale).
//
// All three hold only while the SENDER IS MONOTONIC. The sender is not
// monotonic across a backward clock step larger than bootEpochMaxSkew: the
// persisted term of the seed is bounded, so refineBootEpoch declines to chain
// from the intact higher value AND durably overwrites it with the lower one.
// From then on the peer's archived frames carry a HIGHER epoch than the peer
// itself does, and one of them is enough to raise a floor the live peer is
// then refused at.
//
// "REFUSED AT", NOT "CAN NEVER CLIMB BACK OVER" — an earlier revision of this
// header said never, and the body does not test never. What it asserts is a
// restart ONE SECOND later, which is a lower bound on the lockout, not its
// duration. The production doc has this right: a clock that stays two hours
// slow reads past the archived floor two real hours later, and the epoch it
// then publishes is admitted on the RAISE path and rebinds the floor (see
// refineBootEpoch's decline branch and
// TestPoisonedFloorStillRecoversByRaise_6669). The lockout is bounded by how
// long the published reading stays below the floor — which can be arbitrarily
// long, and is not forever.
//
// The widening this pins, over the plain #6711 sequence, is the ARCHIVED FRAME
// ARRIVING FIRST at a receiver with FRESH state. The floor is then poisoned by
// a CAPTURE rather than by the sender's own live traffic, so the documented
// escape — restart the receiver, the floor is in memory — is defeated at one
// re-injection per restart, exactly as residual 5 defeats the restart recovery
// for the LATCH.

//
// What changed: incarnation B no longer DESTROYS the intact predecessor. It

// came after it".

// The sequence needs the peer to have run a build that SIGNS but emits no
// epoch while holding the current key — rollback, replacement under the same
// identity and key, or a partial upgrade. That precondition is the reason the
// durable latch is still declined: in this very state a durable latch would
// also be refusing the LIVE peer, so its benefit and its worst cost are the
// same configuration. See the epochSeen field comment for the full pricing.
