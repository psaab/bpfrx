// #6669 fold round 10 — the floor's replacement claim was false FOR EQUAL
// EPOCHS, and two of the recovery claims around it were unconditional when the
// behaviour is not.
//
// The claim was: "sustained ring churn needs heartbeatReplaySessions+1 sessions
// at or above the floor, and one incarnation emits exactly one session, so
// epoch-bearing captures buy only a finite ascending pass." The step that fails
// is DISTINCT SESSIONS => DISTINCT EPOCHS. `epoch == highEpoch` fell through to
// the ring, so any number of sessions sharing ONE valid epoch were all admitted
// AT the floor and churned the ring exactly as epochless frames do.
//
// The measurement that produced the claim could not see it: the corpus in
// heartbeat_epoch_test.go hard-codes strictly increasing epochs (1000+i), so it
// held constant the very variable the defect lives in.
//
// The fix binds the floor to a BOUNDED SET of sessions
// (heartbeatAuthState.highEpochSessions, heartbeatEpochSessionsPerEpoch slots,
// reset by a raise). Round 10 shipped that set as a singleton, which refused a
// legitimate successor incarnation on every heartbeat — see
// TestEqualEpochSuccessorIsAdmitted_6669. These tests pin the closed hole, the
// live-peer path it must not break, and both doors out of a poisoned floor.

// TestEqualEpochsCannotChurnTheRing_6669 is the fail-on-revert gate for the
// equal-epoch replay hole.
//
// RED-on-revert: delete the `epoch == s.highEpoch &&
// !s.epochSessionAdmissible(session)` rejection in admitAuthed (or move
// it AFTER the s.replay.admit call, which is the same ordering bug the floor
// itself has to avoid) and both subtests go back to sustained admits.

//  3. request 3 arrives AFTER that decision and must FOLD INTO it.
//
// WHAT THIS ADDS, STATED EXACTLY, because it is narrower than "the branch is
// untested". Mutating the already-pending branch to re-arm a full-loop worker
// (`return true` instead of `return false`) was measured against the whole
// package at 20 runs each:
//
//   - TestOverlappingRefineRequestIsCoalesced_6669      GREEN

//   - this test                                        RED
//
// So the already-pending branch is NOT unguarded — the twenty-request test
// reaches it and its exact pass count catches the re-arm. What that test cannot
// distinguish is the ORDER: its twenty requests all arrive EARLY, while the
// worker is still inside its pass and has not yet run its own pending check, so
// the follow-up is served by that check. Here the worker is parked PAST the
// check, so the owed follow-up can only be served by its release CAS failing and
// the loop re-reading the word. That is a different path to the same coalesce,
// and this is the only test that drives a request into it.
//
// The two mutations are also not interchangeable: making the busy path claim
// UNCONDITIONALLY is caught by the twenty-request test as well, but through the
// early order. Neither mutation is caught by any of the four GREEN tests above,
// which is the coverage this file was missing.

// Manager.refreshBootEpoch bounds "an incarnation stranded below its peer's
// floor is pinned there for the life of the process". It does so by re-reading
// the FILE, so it recovers only what the file can express.

// CONDITION 1 — the floor-raising epoch must have REACHED the file. Refinement
// publishes the raised value before persisting it, deliberately: a node that
// read a predecessor's higher value must still order itself above it even when
// it cannot write (that is the backward-clock-step case persistence exists
// for). The cost is that A can EMIT `b+1` while the file still reads `b`. B
// then has no signal at all — it wrote `b`, the file says `b` — so every
// restart returns at the `prev == lastWrote` shortcut and B stays below the
// peer's floor for its process lifetime. No amount of restarting helps, because
// the information is not in the only channel B reads.
//
// CONDITION 2 — A must be GONE. While both run, each pass raises above the
// other and the file ratchets, so they leapfrog and alternately strand each
// other. TestConcurrentIncarnationsAreOrderedByLockAcquisition_6669 shows the
// recovery working; it makes A exit first, and that is load-bearing.
//
// THE TWO DO NOT NEED THE SAME MISSING STATE, and an earlier revision of this
// comment (and of README.md) said they did. Only CONDITION 2 does: separating
// "a concurrent newer incarnation wrote it" from "a predecessor wrote it after a
// backward clock step" needs a writer identity in the file or a lifetime-held
// liveness lock, which is where the leapfrog lives. CONDITION 1 needs neither —
// the code already does the right thing on a RETRY (A's published value is
// already b+1, so nothing ratchets and the WriteFileDurable is simply
// re-attempted; once b+1 lands, B's next refresh reads it and raises to b+2).
// What is missing there is only a TRIGGER for that retry, which is the "no
// periodic re-check" half of #6724 and a materially smaller change. See
// withEpochFileLock, whose comment is the accurate statement of both.
