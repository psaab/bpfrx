# pkg/cluster

Chassis-cluster HA state machine. Owns node state (Primary, Secondary,
SecondaryHold, Lost, Disabled), redundancy-group election, readiness
gates, manual failover, and the callbacks that fire session/config/IPsec
sync.

## Entry points

The legacy `cluster.go` (2429 LOC) was split in #1541 into sibling
files inside `package cluster`. Public API is preserved verbatim;
locating any symbol below is now a matter of opening the named file.

- `NodeState`, `RedundancyGroupState`, `ClusterEvent`,
  `RetryablePreFailoverError`, `Manager` (struct + `NewManager` +
  lifecycle: `Start`, `Stop`, `Events`, `Monitor`, `NodeID`,
  `ClusterID`, `SetOnEventDrop`, `sendEvent`) — `manager.go`.
- `electRG`, `runElection`, `electSingleNode`, `EffectivePriority`,
  `SetMonitorWeight`, `recalcWeight` — `election.go`.
- `StartHeartbeat`, `StopHeartbeat`, `RestartHeartbeat`,
  `buildHeartbeat`, `handlePeerHeartbeat`, `handlePeerTimeout`,
  `handlePeerNeverSeen`, `HeartbeatStats`,
  `vrfListenConfig` — `heartbeat_manager.go`.
- `HeartbeatPacket`, `MarshalHeartbeat`,
  `UnmarshalHeartbeat`, sender/receiver goroutine types — `heartbeat.go`.
- Single-RG manual failover and transfer-commit protocol
  (`ManualFailover`, `ForceSecondary`, `ResetFailover`,
  `RequestPeerFailover`, `commitRequestedPeerFailover`,
  `abortRequestedPeerFailover`, `notePeerTransferCommitted`,
  `FinalizePeerTransferOut`, `FenceStatus`), the batch variants
  (`ManualFailoverBatch`, `RequestPeerFailoverBatch`,
  `FinalizePeerTransferOutBatch`, etc.), and all transfer-commit
  state machine `*Locked` helpers
  (`applyPeerTransferOutOverrideLocked`,
  `clearPeerTransferOutOverrideLocked`,
  `restorePeerTransferOutOverrideLocked`,
  `transferCommitGracePeriodLocked`,
  `suppressPeerTimeoutForTransferCommitLocked`,
  `applyTransferCommitOverridesOnPeerStateLocked`) — `failover.go`.
  Co-locating the entire manual-failover locking domain in one
  file keeps the "committed-failover-suppresses-stale-heartbeat"
  invariant answerable by reading one file end-to-end.
- Readiness gate (`SetRGReady`) — `readiness.go`.
- Group-state accessors (`UpdateConfig`, `GroupStates`,
  `DataGroupIDs`, `GroupState`, `IsLocalPrimary`,
  `IsLocalPrimaryAny`, `LocalPriorities`) — `group_state.go`.
- Peer-state accessors (`PeerAlive`, `PeerNodeID`,
  `PeerGroupStates`, software/HA-protocol version,
  `PeerMonitorStatuses`) — `peer_state.go`.
- Sync state (`SetSyncReady`, `IsSyncReady`,
  `SetSyncTransport`, `SyncTransport`, `SetSyncStats`,
  `GetSyncStats`, `IsSyncConnected`) — `sync_state.go`.
- Hooks (`SetPreManualFailoverHook`,
  `SetTransferReadinessFunc`,
  `SetLocalTransferCommitReadyHook`,
  `SetPeerFailoverFunc`, `SetPeerFailoverCommitFunc`,
  `SetPeerFailoverBatchFunc`,
  `SetPeerFailoverCommitBatchFunc`, `SetPeerFenceFunc`,
  `SetPeerTimeoutGuard`) — `hooks.go`.
- Event-history methods (`RecordEvent`, `EventHistoryFor`) —
  `events_log.go`. Underlying types and `EventHistory` ring
  buffer — `events.go`.
- Status formatting (`FormatStatus`, `FormatInformation`,
  `FormatStatistics`, `FormatControlPlaneStatistics`,
  `FormatDataPlaneStatistics`, `FormatDataPlaneInterfaces`,
  `FormatIPMonitoringStatus`, `FormatInterfaces`,
  `InterfaceMonitorInfo`, `RethInfo`, `InterfacesInput`) —
  `status.go`.
- `triggerGARP` (no-op/log hook today — native VRRP owns GARP),
  plus the gratuitous-ARP / unsolicited-NA burst senders — `garp.go`.
  `SendGratuitousARPBurst` / `SendGratuitousIPv6Burst` send the first
  frame synchronously (error returned to the caller) and the remaining
  follow-up frames at 50ms intervals in a background goroutine. The
  follow-up sends are the failover-convergence reliability mechanism, so
  their send errors are NOT dropped: each failed follow-up frame bumps the
  package-level `burstSendErrors` counter (exported via `BurstSendErrors()`
  for observability) and is logged at Debug; a single Warn fires after the
  burst if any frame failed. The loop never aborts on a transient SEND error
  (#2623). The burst remains non-blocking and the #2081/#2082 epoch +
  dampener storm-control gates live in `pkg/vrrp`, untouched by this.
  The follow-up loop DOES abort cleanly — before any further frame — on
  abdication: `SendGratuitousARPBurstGated` / `SendGratuitousIPv6BurstGated`
  take a `BurstStillValid func() bool` predicate, captured at burst start and
  checked before EVERY follow-up frame; `pkg/vrrp.sendGARP` passes a closure
  that returns true only while the node is still master AND `garpEpoch` is
  unchanged (#2867). When it returns false the loop stops, so a node that
  loses master (or whose burst is superseded by a newer epoch) mid-burst stops
  re-poisoning neighbor caches for VIPs it no longer owns. The original
  `SendGratuitousARPBurst` / `SendGratuitousIPv6Burst` are thin wrappers that
  pass a nil predicate (ungated, run-to-completion) for callers with no
  per-instance epoch/state to gate against (direct-mode re-announce, tests).
- `SessionSync` — `sync.go`, `sync_conn.go`, `sync_bulk.go`, `runtime.go`. HA
  session replication. After #1518, `NewSessionSync`, `NewDualSessionSync`,
  and `SetRuntime` accept the narrow `clusterRuntime` (see `runtime.go`) —
  `Sessions() dataplane.SessionStore` plus `Telemetry() dataplane.Telemetry`.
  Both the legacy `*dataplane.Manager` and the userspace
  `LegacyDataPlaneAdapter` satisfy `clusterRuntime` directly. The deprecated
  `SetDataPlane(dataplane.DataPlane)` setter is retained one release cycle
  for any out-of-tree caller and routes through the same
  `SessionStoreOf`/`TelemetryOf` adapters. The receive, sweep, bulk export,
  and stale-reconcile paths must stay on those runtime-domain interfaces.

The primary consumer of the `Manager.Events()` channel is
`pkg/daemon/daemon_ha.go`, which fans events out (HA sync, status
publish, etc.). `pkg/cluster/reth.go::HandleStateChange` is a
state-handler method, not the event-channel consumer.

## DHCP-server lease sync (#2239)

DHCP-server (Kea) leases ride the SAME session-sync channel and follow the
IPsec-SA-sync precedent (`QueueIPsecSA` / `peerIPsecSAs` /
`reinitiateIPsecSAs`), not the Kea native HA hook and not a shared DB. The
mechanism (PATH C of `docs/research/2239-dhcp-ha-lease-sync/plan.md`):

- **Wire** — two additive message types `syncMsgDHCPLeaseV4 = 25` /
  `syncMsgDHCPLeaseV6 = 26` carry a full-set push of the active leases the
  sender serves for a family. `encode/decodeDHCPLeasePayload` (`sync_protocol.go`)
  frame a 4-byte count + length-prefixed, length-GATED per-lease records
  (the #2170 trailing-field discipline: a newer peer's extra fields are
  ignored, a legacy/truncated record zero-fills absent fields, a
  short stream stops at the last complete record). The types are above the
  legacy set so a peer that predates the feature hits the `default` receive
  case and ignores them — no `CurrentHAProtocolVersion` bump (the change is
  additive AND config-knob-gated, so bumping would falsely block session sync
  across a mixed-base pair).
- **Clock invariant** — each lease carries REMAINING LIFETIME, never an
  absolute wall-clock expiry (the channel only syncs a MONOTONIC offset). The
  promoting node re-anchors to its LOCAL clock at seed (`expire = now + remaining`),
  so peer wall-clock skew can never mis-age a synced lease — the structural
  fix for the <60s hazard the Kea native HA hook inherits.
- **Send** — `SessionSync.QueueDHCPLeases(family, leases)` (`sync.go`), driven
  by the RG-MASTER push loop in `pkg/daemon/daemon_dhcp_lease_sync.go`
  (`syncDHCPLeasesPeriodic`): a 30s full-set heartbeat (so a restarted standby
  is never empty) + a 2s on-grant change-detect (push only when the set
  changed, bounding the duplicate-allocation window). Fail-open: a send error
  is logged + counted, never blocks lease granting.
- **Hold** — the BACKUP stores the peer's set in `peerDHCPLeases{4,6}` (the
  `peerIPsecSAs` precedent), accessible via `PeerDHCPLeases{4,6}()`. Its Kea
  stays STOPPED (`clearRethServicesForRG` is UNCHANGED) — VRRP/RG remains the
  sole who-serves arbiter.
- **Seed on takeover** — `pkg/daemon` pre-seeds the held leases into the Kea
  memfile BEFORE Kea start (fully closes the dup-alloc window) AND
  `lease{4,6}-add`s them over the Kea control socket after start (idempotent
  backstop, `RecordDHCPLeasesSeeded`). The Kea read/write side lives in
  `pkg/dhcpserver/lease_sync.go`.
- **Observability** — `SyncStats.DHCPLeases{Sent,Received,Seeded}` surfaced in
  `show chassis cluster statistics` (`status.go`).

Gated end-to-end on `set chassis cluster dhcp-lease-synchronization`
(`config.ClusterConfig.DHCPLeaseSync`); standalone / knob-off renders the Kea
config bit-identical to pre-#2239 (no control-socket, no hook).

## Interface-monitor link-state detection

`Monitor` (`monitor.go`) is the live carrier-detection loop: a 1-second
ticker polls each configured `interface-monitor`, dampens transitions,
and calls `SetMonitorWeight` so a redundancy group is demoted when a
monitored uplink goes down. The whole point of interface-monitoring is to
catch carrier loss (cable pulled / peer link down) and fail over.

Link health is therefore decided from the kernel **operational** state
(`IFLA_OPERSTATE`) via the exported `LinkAttrsUp`, **not** the
administrative `IFF_UP` flag. xpfd admin-ups every managed interface, so
`IFF_UP` is the normal steady state and stays set even after carrier loss
— using it (or OR-ing it in) would report a cable-pulled link as UP and
suppress failover (#2070). The rule is: `OperUp` → up; `OperUnknown` →
fall back to the admin flag (virtual devices and 802.1Q VLAN
sub-interfaces that report no independent carrier state); `OperDown` /
`OperLowerLayerDown` / anything else → down. This mirrors
`pkg/vrrp.linkAttrsUp`, the canonical link-state read used by VRRP
track-interface detection. `pkg/routing/monitor.go` (the display-side
`InterfaceMonitorStatus` path) carries its own identical copy.

`LinkAttrsUp` is exported because the same carrier-aware read is needed
outside the monitor loop:

- `RethController.FormatStatus` (`reth.go`) and the reth-status displays
  for `show chassis cluster interfaces` — both the gRPC/remote-CLI path
  (`pkg/grpcapi`) and the local interactive CLI path (`pkg/cli`) — so a
  cable-pulled-but-admin-up RETH member shows `down`/`Down`, not
  `up`/`Up`, and the two display paths stay in agreement.
- The daemon no-reth-vrrp / private-rg-election VIP-readiness gate
  (`pkg/daemon.checkVIPReadinessForConfig`, #2090) — so a node is not
  judged ready to take over VIPs on an interface whose carrier is down
  (the #2070 hazard, surfacing on the VIP-takeover path).

## Callers

`pkg/daemon`, `pkg/cli`, `pkg/grpcapi`, `pkg/vrrp`.

## Dependencies

`config`, `dataplane`.

## Failover timing (CLAUDE.md authoritative)

- ~60 ms with default 30 ms VRRP advertisements (masterDownInterval ~97 ms).
- Planned shutdown: burst of 3× priority-0 advertisements; peer takes over
  in ~1 ms.
- Failback: ~130 ms (daemon startup + BPF load + sync hold release).
- Heartbeat: 200 ms interval, threshold 5 (1 s detection).
- Event debounce 500 ms before priority updates fire.

## Gotchas

- `Ready` and `TransferReady` are different gates. `Ready` allows VRRP to
  participate in election; `TransferReady` is the stricter gate for
  explicit operator-initiated `request chassis cluster failover`.
- `TakeoverHoldTime` adds extra delay before election when this node would
  immediately preempt. Used to avoid election thrash on simultaneous boot.
- HA delete-sync callbacks fire from the GC loop. They must not block, and
  must log at `slog.Debug` — earlier `slog.Info` flooded at 15 req/s and
  drowned out real diagnostics (per CLAUDE.md logging rules).
- The incremental sync sweep (`sync_conn.go`) re-syncs a session ONLY on
  `val.Created >= threshold` — it deliberately does NOT re-publish an
  established flow on `LastSeen` activity (#270 narrowed this; #131's
  `|| val.LastSeen >= threshold` clause was removed on purpose to keep the
  empty-sweep back-off and avoid >1/s control-socket contention). Standby
  retention of long-lived synced sessions is NOT the sweep's job — it is
  owned by the userspace Rust timer wheel's standby gate (#2120,
  `userspace-dp/src/session/expire.rs`): the standby HOLDS a peer-synced
  session for an RG it does not forward instead of aging it. Do NOT
  "restore the LastSeen re-sync" to fix a failover-retention bug — that
  re-introduces the per-second control-socket hammer #270 removed; the fix
  belongs in the wheel. The sweep narrowing is intentional and must stay.
- Session-sync key-only delete messages use `SessionStore.DeleteWithCompanions*`.
  Bulk stale reconciliation must use the known-value batch delete path through
  `SessionStore.ReconcileClusterBulk`, which deletes with the iterator's
  `(key,value)` snapshot. Reverse-session, DNAT/DNATv6, and persistent-NAT
  side effects are backend-owned; do not add local map cleanup in
  `pkg/cluster`.
- **Install-generation delete guard (#2170, #2221)**: every session install and
  every delete carries a per-`(sender,key)` monotonic install generation as a
  length-gated trailing `uint64` (see `docs/sync-protocol.md`). The sender
  (`sync_conn.go`/`sync_bulk.go`) stamps installs from a single boot-seeded
  counter. A delete draws a **fresh, strictly-greater** generation
  (`takeDeleteGenV4/V6` → `nextInstallGen`) rather than echoing the install's
  stamp, so a delete always out-ranks the install it cancels — this is what makes
  a reordered delete/install pair orderable (#2221). The comparison is always
  same-`(sender,key)`-domain, even across an ownership change.
  The receiver keeps the authoritative per-key stored generation in
  `SessionSync.recvGenV4/V6` (the BPF C struct stays generation-free) and the
  apply layer refuses a delete whose generation is **strictly older** than the
  stored entry (`deleteClusterSynced*`, `DeletesStaleIgnored`) and refuses an
  install that would regress the stored generation (`installClusterSynced*`,
  `InstallsStaleIgnored`). Equality applies; `gen == 0` on either side falls
  back to today's unconditional behavior (rolling-upgrade safe). This stops a
  journaled/deferred delete for a closed flow from killing a same-5-tuple
  replacement that was re-synced with a newer generation. Do NOT reuse the
  synthesized `SessionID` for this — it is non-monotonic
  (`now_seconds<<16|slot`) and collides on same-second/same-slot reuse.
  **#2221 (same-generation reorder residual):** an applied non-zero delete now
  records the delete generation as a **TOMBSTONE** in `recvGenV4/V6` (it does not
  evict). A reordered install of the very session that delete cancelled carries
  the OLDER install generation and is refused by the install guard, so the
  standby converges to the master's state (session GONE) regardless of
  install/delete arrival order; a genuinely newer incarnation (re-stamped by a
  later sweep) carries a higher generation and still installs (last-writer-wins).
  A `gen == 0` (legacy) delete still evicts. The generation maps are bounded by
  `genGuardMapCap` (200000); on overflow the map is NEVER cleared (#2198 F1) — an
  existing key updates in place, a new key skip-records (degrades to safe gen-0)
  and bumps `GenMapOverflow`. The receiver also RESETS `recvGenV4/V6` when the
  peer begins a bulk transfer (`resetRecvGen` from the `syncMsgBulkStart`
  handler, #2198 F2) so a rebooted peer — whose monotonic-seeded counter
  legitimately restarts lower — has its cold-start bulk re-prime accepted instead
  of refused as stale (the stale-RETAIN inverse of #2170), and so a delete
  tombstone never permanently blocks a legitimate cold re-prime. The
  check→Put→record apply sequence is not held under one `recvGenMu` acquisition;
  it is safe because the per-peer receive path is single-threaded over the single
  active fabric (#2198 F3).
- Dual-active overlap is intentional: primary sets `rg_active=true`
  immediately on becoming master; secondary defers `rg_active=false` until
  it sees the VRRP BACKUP event. Brief overlap, never both inactive.
- `handlePeerTimeout` runs its peer-timeout guard (`peerTimeoutGuardFn`) with
  `m.mu` released, so the receiver read path can run `handlePeerHeartbeat`
  during the call for ANY guard duration (a configured slow guard only widens
  the window). After the guard it re-checks heartbeat STALENESS via
  `peerHeartbeatFreshLocked`, not just `peerAlive` (#2080): a heartbeat that
  lands during the guard window keeps `peerAlive` true but is a fresh
  heartbeat, so the only correct post-guard question is "is the heartbeat
  fresh again?". `peerHeartbeatFreshLocked`
  re-reads the receiver's `lastSeen` against the live monotonic clock (test
  seam: `peerHeartbeatFreshFn`); a fresh heartbeat aborts the peer-lost
  transition and prevents spurious failover churn. A nil receiver / unset seam
  reports not-fresh, so the no-receiver call paths behave exactly as before the
  re-check existed.
