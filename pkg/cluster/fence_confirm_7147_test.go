// #7147 — the `peer-fencing disable-rg-confirmed` policy at the Manager level.
//
// Two properties, and the suite is only meaningful if it holds BOTH:
//
//  1. ORDERING. The fence is sent and confirmed BEFORE this node claims the
//     redundancy groups. Without this the policy is decoration.
//  2. LIVENESS. Every way the confirmation can fail still results in a
//     takeover. Without this the policy is an outage generator, and it would be
//     a worse defect than the gap #7147 set out to close.

// confirmFenceManager returns a manager armed with the confirmed policy, primed
// so handlePeerTimeout runs its fence branch.
