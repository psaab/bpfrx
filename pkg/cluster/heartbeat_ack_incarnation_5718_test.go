// invariant a second slot-niller has to satisfy is intrinsic preservation of an
// occupied slot, which is what the eviction's keep-slot refusal supplies. A new
// teardown without that property could empty the registry without clearing the
// capability, and every behavioural test in this file would still pass.

// #5718 fold r6 added the second one. Before it, the exemption rested on what
// the single caller happened to do — installConn installs before it evicts —
// which is not something this allowlist can enforce. A future caller naming a
// slot it had not filled yet would have emptied the registry while BOTH guards
// stayed green: this one allowlists the function by NAME, and
// TestInstallConnNeverLeavesTheRegistryEmpty_5718 drives the existing call
