// #6724: a refine pass that could not PERSIST used to have no retry at all.
// The only re-run was at the next heartbeat (re)start, which is event-driven
// and unbounded — a daemon can run for days without one. Meanwhile a peer that
// latched a raise this node emitted but could not write refuses a concurrent
// incarnation, which has no other channel to learn of it.
//
// These pin the trigger and, just as importantly, WHEN IT MUST NOT FIRE.

// TestPersistOwedIsSetOnlyByFAULTS_6724 is the discriminator the whole trigger
// rests on: a pass that DECLINED to write on purpose must not be retried.
//
// The #6711 preserve branch is the case that makes a cheaper design wrong. It
// ends with the published epoch (this incarnation's wall-clock seed) different
// from what this incarnation has written (nothing), and it ends that way
// FOREVER, deliberately — so a trigger keyed on `published != wrote` would spin
// on a preserved file for the life of the process, re-reading state #7499 went
// out of its way to leave alone.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: making refineBootEpochReporting return `persistOwed = true`
// from the preserve or heal branch reds the "declined" rows; dropping it from
// the write-failure branch reds the "faulted" rows.
