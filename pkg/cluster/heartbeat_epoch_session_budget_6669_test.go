// #6669 fold round 11 — round 10 bound the floor to EXACTLY ONE session per
// epoch value, and that refuses a healthy node rather than an attacker.
//
// Round 10's stated bound was "durable only under the dead-clock AND dead-store
// pair, which is precisely the regime in which the sender publishes no order at
// all". It is false. refineBootEpoch chains with `if next := prev + 1; next >
// epoch`, which is a pure function of the FILE, so a store that READS but cannot
// WRITE hands every successive incarnation the identical value — on a perfectly
// healthy, advancing clock, with different seeds and different sessions.
// Refinement, offered by that text as the escape, is the equal-epoch GENERATOR
// whenever persist fails.
//
// The bound is now heartbeatEpochSessionsPerEpoch slots rather than one. These
// tests pin the successor case that must be admitted and the two properties the
// slots must keep: they are spent at most once per epoch value, and nothing an
// attacker can produce refills them.

// epochUnwritableStore points bootEpochPath at a directory whose state file
// READS but cannot be WRITTEN, holding a value ahead of `now` but inside
// bootEpochMaxSkew.
//
// That is one ordinary appliance fault (a full or read-only /var) plus one
// ordinary clock event (an RTC that ran fast, corrected back by NTP under an
// hour). Neither is a dead clock and neither is a dead store: the `.lock`
// already exists so withEpochFileLock takes it and os.ReadFile succeeds, and
// only WriteFileDurable's temp file fails. It returns the state path and the
// value in the file.

// clock to climb past prev+1 AND another restart — up to however far the file
// leads the clock, at most bootEpochMaxSkew.
//
// Closing it needs the sender to stop republishing one value, and ENTROPY IS NOT
// WHAT IS MISSING — an earlier revision of this comment said the degenerate case
// (a clock at or before the Unix epoch with no chainable file) had "nothing to
// draw on". It has 64 crypto-random bits already: every Manager draws an
// incarnation session id from crypto/rand at its first signed send
// (randomSessionID, via Manager.heartbeatNonce), with no dependence on the clock
// or on the file, and already carries it in every frame.
//
// What blocks using it is that the EPOCH is an ordering value, not an identity:
// the receiver compares it with < and >, so folding random bits in produces a
// successor that can land BELOW its predecessor, which admitAuthed refuses
// outright — trading a bounded stranding for an unbounded one. Distinctness
// would have to come from something MONOTONE the sender can produce without the
