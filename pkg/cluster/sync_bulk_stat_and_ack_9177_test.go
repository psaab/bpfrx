// #9177 — two small, INDEPENDENT defects in the same bulk-sync reader. They are
// unrelated edits and are kept in separate cells deliberately.
//
//	V052  the three `s.stats.BulkSync*` stores run ABOVE the #8966 accept
//	      decision, so a REFUSED BulkStart still zeroes the bulk telemetry.
//	V053  `BulkAck` accepts a FUTURE epoch (`epoch < pending` rather than
//	      `epoch != pending`), releasing the #3912 failover gate on a bulk
//	      that never completed.
//
// Both are recorded at the severity that survived their own re-derivation, not
// the one they were filed at. V052's filed headline — that the `len(payload) >=
// 8` read admits a malformed short frame — is REFUTED and is not tested here: a
// short frame is read as epoch 0 and is only accepted when no bulk is in
// progress, a state in which any epoch is accepted, so it grants nothing a
// well-formed frame does not. V053 needs a non-conforming or compromised peer
// past the #5303 pre-auth admission, which is why it is Low; it is fixed because
// the comparator has no reason to be loose and the fix is one operator.

// ── V052: the stat reset must run BELOW the accept ────────────────────────

// statusFor9177 renders the operator-facing `show chassis cluster information`
// text from a Manager wired to this SessionSync — `Manager.FormatInformation`,
// which is what `pkg/cli`'s showChassisClusterInformation prints and where the
// "Cold synchronization" block lives. (`FormatStatus`, the shorter render, does
// not carry it; the fixture guard below is what caught that, and it is kept so a
// future reader cannot mistake an absent section for a passing assertion.)
//
// THE OBSERVABLE IS THE STATUS, NOT THE ACCEPT DECISION. An assertion on the
// accept path cannot see this defect at all: the accept is CORRECT — #8966 made
// it so — and what is wrong is that three statements ran before it. So the cell
// has to read what the operator reads.
