// #7164: a committed heartbeat interval/threshold must reach the RUNNING
// heartbeat.
//
// StartHeartbeat snapshots m.hbInterval/m.hbThreshold into the sender and
// receiver; UpdateConfig rewrites the manager fields on every commit; and
// RestartHeartbeat had exactly ONE production caller — the VRF-rebind path. So
// `set chassis cluster heartbeat-interval` updated the manager and never
// reached the wire, and peers declared death too early or too late relative to
// the committed configuration until some unrelated event rebuilt the heartbeat.
//
// WHAT THE FIXTURE HAS TO SEPARATE. liveHeartbeatTimingLocked FALLS BACK to the
// desired values when no receiver exists, so `live == desired` is true both when
// the timing is already correct AND when there is no heartbeat running at all.
// A test that only checked "does it restart when they differ" would be satisfied
// by an implementation that restarted on every commit, and one that only checked
// the no-op case would be satisfied by an implementation that never restarted.
// Both states are therefore exercised explicitly, with a running receiver
// present in exactly the cells that need one.

// installReceiverWithTiming fakes a RUNNING heartbeat whose live timing is the
// given pair. Only the timing fields are read by the predicate under test, so no
// socket or goroutine is needed — which also keeps the cell free of the bind
// races a real StartHeartbeat would introduce.
