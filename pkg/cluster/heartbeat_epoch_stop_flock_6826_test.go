// #6826: what does a RETURNED Manager.Stop imply about the cross-process epoch
// flock?
//
// Manager.Stop joins the boot-epoch refinement worker with a bounded budget
// (bootEpochStopJoinBudget) and, on timeout, warns and returns. The worker is
// not cancelled — withEpochFileLock has already taken LOCK_EX and defers its
// release until after the callback's durable write and fsync, so a Stop whose
// budget expires mid-callback returns to its caller while a lock that OTHER
// PROCESSES can see is still held.
//
// That matters here rather than in general because restart is the documented
// recovery path for this subsystem: a day-2 chassis-cluster topology or
// identity change is REFUSED at commit and requires a process restart
// (pkg/daemon/cluster_topology_preflight.go). The incoming process is exactly
// the party positioned to find the outgoing one's lock still held.
//
// The behaviour was documented but never pinned, so it could drift either way
// unnoticed. These cells pin it.

// tryEpochFlock reports whether the epoch lock at path can be taken RIGHT NOW
// by an independent open file description.
//
// A second os.OpenFile creates a separate open file DESCRIPTION, and flock(2)
// associates a lock with the description rather than the process — so this
// contends with a lock held elsewhere in this same process exactly as another
// process would. The cell below asserts that property directly rather than
// assuming it, because the whole test is worthless if it does not hold.
