// Cross-process locking for the HA boot-epoch state file.
//
// Split out of heartbeat_epoch.go (#6826): the acquisition policy is a
// self-contained concern — how long to wait for a lock another PROCESS holds,
// and which errno means "wait" versus "give up" — and it is the part a reader
// chasing a startup delay needs, without the epoch chaining and wire-format
// reasoning around it.

// withEpochFileLock serializes a read-modify-write of an epoch state file
// across PROCESSES, not merely within one.
//
// Within a process the one file this guards has a single writer at a time
// (Manager.startBootEpochRefine admits one refine worker), but nothing in xpf
// enforces a single daemon instance: there is no pidfile, and the gRPC listener
// sets SO_REUSEPORT (pkg/grpcapi/server.go), so a second xpfd does NOT fail on a
// port collision the way it otherwise would. Two overlapping incarnations could
// therefore interleave read-modify-write, and an interleaved one can lose the
// update the other just made. An advisory lock on a sidecar file is cheaper than
// reasoning about whether the race is reachable.
//
// IT DOES NOT ORDER INCARNATIONS, and an earlier revision of this comment said
// it did ("publish epochs that are not strictly ordered — which is precisely the
// property the whole mechanism rests on"). It serializes by LOCK ACQUISITION,
// and there is no happens-before edge from daemon start, or from survivorship,
// to that acquisition. heartbeatBootEpoch publishes the wall-clock seed and
// starts emitting BEFORE its worker reaches this function, deliberately (a
// storage fault must not take a healthy node off the air), so the two orders are
// independent. Older incarnation A publishes `a` and is delayed; newer B
// publishes `b > a`, locks first, persists `b`; A locks second, reads `b`,
// raises itself to `b+1` and persists that. The peer then latches `b+1` from the
// OLDER incarnation and refuses the NEWER one at `b`.
//
// That mis-ordering is not closed here, and it cannot be with this file alone:
// refinement only ever matters when the persisted value exceeds our own seed,
// and "a predecessor wrote it after a backward clock step" and "a concurrent
// newer incarnation wrote it" produce the identical file. Separating them needs
// state this design does not keep — a lifetime-held liveness lock, or a writer
// identity in the file — i.e. a larger change than the epoch itself. What IS
// closed is the unrecoverable half: refinement is re-runnable
// (Manager.refreshBootEpoch), so the stranded incarnation raises itself above
// the file again at its next heartbeat (re)start instead of being pinned below
// the floor for the life of the process by a one-shot sync.Once. Between the
// mis-ordering and that next start this node IS refused. #6724 closed the
// half of that gap which was a MISSING TRIGGER rather than missing state —
// Manager.retryOwedBootEpochPersist re-runs refinement from the sender loop
// when, and only when, a pass could not persist — and the mis-ordering itself
// is tracked as #7501. See
// TestConcurrentIncarnationsAreOrderedByLockAcquisition_6669.
//
// THAT RECOVERY CARRIES TWO CONDITIONS, and stating it flat overstates it. The
// re-run reads the FILE, so it can only recover what the file expresses:
//
//   - THE FLOOR-RAISING EPOCH MUST HAVE REACHED THE FILE. refineBootEpoch
//     publishes a raise BEFORE persisting it, deliberately — a node that has
//     read a predecessor's higher value must still order itself above that
//     value even when it cannot write, which is the backward-clock-step case
//     persistence exists for. So A can EMIT `b+1` while the file still reads
//     `b`. B then has no signal at all: it wrote `b`, the file says `b`, and
//     every restart returns at refineBootEpoch's `prev == lastWrote` shortcut.
//     B stays below the peer's floor for its whole process lifetime, however
//     many times it restarts, because the information is not in the only
//     channel it reads.
//   - THE OTHER INCARNATION MUST BE GONE. While both run, each pass raises
//     above the other and rewrites the file, so they leapfrog indefinitely and
//     alternately strand each other while the file ratchets. The test above
//     makes A exit before B re-refines, and that step is load-bearing.
//
// Both are characterized in
// TestRefineRecoveryNeedsTheRaisingEpochInTheFile_6669, and they are tracked
// with the mis-ordering — but they do NOT both need the same missing state, and
// an earlier revision of this comment said they did.
//
// CONDITION 2 does: separating "a concurrent newer incarnation wrote it" from
// "a predecessor wrote it after a backward clock step" needs a writer identity
// or a lifetime-held liveness lock, which is where the leapfrog lives.
//
// CONDITION 1 needs neither, and is CLOSED (#6724). It needed A to RETRY ITS
// FAILED PERSIST, and the code already did the right thing on a retry: A's
// published value is already b+1, so `next := prev+1` is not > epoch, nothing
// ratchets, and the WriteFileDurable is simply re-attempted. Once b+1 reaches
// the file, B's next refreshBootEpoch reads it, raises to b+2 and is admitted.
// What was missing was only a TRIGGER for that retry, which is a materially
// smaller change than a writer identity: refineBootEpochReporting now reports
// whether a persist is OWED, and Manager.retryOwedBootEpochPersist re-runs
// refinement from the heartbeat sender loop while one is. The gate is
// load-bearing in the other direction too — an UNCONDITIONAL periodic refine
// would make the leapfrog below continuous, so both nodes would be refused for
// part of every period instead of one being refused until its next restart.
//
// Fails CLOSED: if the lock cannot be taken, the read-modify-write is SKIPPED
// rather than run unlocked. A lock whose failure path executes the critical
// section anyway is not a lock — it reinstates the very race it exists to
// prevent, exactly when the guard cannot fire.
//
// WHY DECLINING IS RIGHT, not merely cheap. Proceeding unlocked does not trade
// correctness for liveness; it trades a TRANSIENT liveness risk for a DURABLE
// one. A raced read-modify-write can leave a lower epoch in the file than an
// overlapping incarnation already emitted. That value is read back as `prev` on
// the next boot, and it is exactly the term that matters after a backward clock
// step — the one case persistence exists for. The epoch then produced can sit
// BELOW the peer's latched floor, where admitAuthed refuses it: the same
// false-peer-death the fail-open was supposed to avoid, moved one restart later
// and made durable rather than transient. Corrupting the state whose only job is
// surviving a clock step is not a safe way to fail.
//
// What declining costs is bounded and transient by comparison: the wall-clock
// epoch is already published and already on the wire (see
// Manager.heartbeatBootEpoch), so only backward-clock-step protection is lost,
// and only until the next resolve succeeds.
//
// The old justification — "a node that cannot lock must not be a node that
// cannot heartbeat" — was a SENDER-liveness argument applied to a call site that
// is not on the heartbeat path at all. This runs on refineBootEpoch's worker,
// off both the send loop and the receive loop, so declining it cannot stop this
// node emitting anything. It also matches its siblings: MkdirAllDurable failure
// already declines and WriteFileDurable failure already declines, so lock
// failure was the only branch of three that proceeded.
