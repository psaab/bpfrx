//
// AcceptsArgs is honoured in Canonicalize and NOWHERE ELSE. That is a
// deliberate asymmetry, not an oversight: "offers completions" and "accepts an
// argument" are different properties, and the completion walkers ask the first
// one. A walker that honoured AcceptsArgs would offer a bare value slot as if
// it were a completion source, and — worse — a reader who saw it honoured in
// two places would reasonably conclude it is a general "this node is permissive"
// flag and mark nodes whose dispatcher refuses the argument.
//
// Left as a comment, that scope is a claim that is true when written and false
// the moment someone honours it in another walker. This binds it.
//
// The check is AST-based, not grep-based, so a rename or a reflow cannot make
// it silently stop matching: it counts SELECTOR reads (`x.AcceptsArgs`), which
// excludes both the field declaration and the `AcceptsArgs: true` composite
// literal keys that mark nodes.

// acceptsArgsReadSites returns enclosing-function name -> read count for
// selector reads of the named field across the package's PRODUCTION files.
// Test files are excluded deliberately: this asserts where the SHIPPING code
// honours the flag, and a test is entitled to read it to make assertions.
