// Round-9 differential guards for the two event-options arms #6659 widened.
//
// Both arms read Children EXCLUSIVELY before #6659 — unlike every other leaf in
// that change, which read nodeVal and therefore already preferred the node's own
// tail. That asymmetry is the whole bug class here: widening a Children-only
// reader to "tail AND children" PROMOTES tokens the previous reader discarded,
// and for these two arms the discarded token reaches a runtime consumer that
// rejects it. The result is a configuration BOTH trees accept where only the
// widened one makes the policy inert — which no compile-level assertion about
// the intermediate string can catch.
//
// Every case below therefore asserts the CONSUMER's verdict (does the constraint
// set admit the event / does the batch classify into an executable plan), and
// compares it against what origin/master's reader produces for the same AST
// rather than against a hand-written expectation.
