// Every schema node declaring `compoundKey: true` is named "family", and every
// node named "family" declares it. The two sets are EQUAL, in both directions.
//
// WHY THIS IS PINNED RATHER THAN COMMENTED. Two instruments built for #8763
// depend on the equivalence and neither states it as an assumption it can check:
//
//   - a fixture builder that renders compound containers as ONE node decides
//     which containers those are BY NAME. Its author flagged it as "exact only
//     because all seven declarations happen to share that name" — a heuristic
//     wearing an exact answer's clothes.
//   - the traversal-defect diagnosis is scoped to `compoundKey` containers, and
//     the population argument ("seven, all named family") is quoted by name.
//
// The equivalence holds today in BOTH directions, so the name predicate is not a
// heuristic — it is exact. But an eighth declaration of EITHER kind silently
// invalidates one instrument or the other:
//
//	a `compoundKey` node NOT named "family"  -> the fixture builder renders it as
//	                                            two levels, measures the shape the
//	                                            census invents, and reports clean
//	                                            about a spelling nobody writes
//	a node named "family" WITHOUT compoundKey -> the builder merges a container the
//	                                            pass traverses correctly, and
//	                                            manufactures a defect that is not there
//
// Both directions produce a plausible number rather than a failure, which is why
// this is a cell and not a note. It costs one schema walk.
