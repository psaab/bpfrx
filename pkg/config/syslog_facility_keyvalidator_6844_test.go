//
// `system syslog <dest> <facility> <severity>` models the facility as the
// schema's wildcard KEY. The severity VALUE has been enum-gated since #2008;
// the key carried no keyValidator, so an arbitrary string -- including one
// carrying ';', whitespace, or a newline -- passed SchemaValidate and committed.
//
// #6829 belted the RENDER site, so nothing injected reaches rendered rsyslog
// configuration. This is the other half: the commit path accepted the value, so
// the operator got no error and their configuration silently did not do what it
// said.

// schemaValidateSrc parses src and runs the typed-leaf gate over it, returning
// the gate's error.
//
// It runs SchemaValidate specifically, not CompileConfig, because that is the
// gate under test and because the strictness boundary matters: SchemaValidate is
// strict only on the operator-driven commit path, and Store.compileTreeLenient
// downgrades a violation to a warning on the tolerant Load / SyncApply ingress
// (#1319). Asserting at this layer is what makes the #1960 no-brick contract
// hold without a new lenient opt.
