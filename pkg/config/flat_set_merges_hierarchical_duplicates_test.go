// The flat `set` spelling MERGES into an existing instance, structurally, for
// every container. Hand-written hierarchical text with a repeated instance
// block does NOT — it produces two — everywhere except the containers #8752
// folds.
//
// #8752 UPDATE. This cell used to state the contrast as unconditional, and it
// was pinned at `security policies ... policy`. The #8752 fold merges a
// repeated `policy` on the TOLERANT path, so at that one container the two
// spellings have now converged, and the sub-test that discriminated there can
// no longer see the substitution trap it was built to catch. The trap did not
// go away with it: the fold is scoped to a PAIR LIST, not to a shape, so every
// container outside that list still duplicates where `set` merges. The
// discriminating sub-test therefore moved to `security nat source rule-set`,
// measured (not assumed) to still show the split, and `policy` kept a
// sub-test asserting the CONVERGENCE instead — which doubles as the top-level
// regression guard for the fold.
//
// This cell exists because three separate people got that wrong on ONE issue in
// ONE day, each writing hierarchical text through NewParser as a stand-in for
// what a CLI `set` session produces, and each drawing a conclusion the flat
// spelling does not support. CLAUDE.md names the rule outright ("Testing flat
// set syntax: ALWAYS use ParseSetCommand() + tree.SetPath() loop, NEVER
// NewParser()"), and prose did not stop it, so the difference is pinned here
// where someone reasoning about a packed spelling can run into it.
//
// It is not carelessness. Hand-written hierarchical text LOOKS like a faithful
// rendering of a CLI session, and the merge behaviour is the entire difference
// between the two. A fixture that gets it wrong does not fail — it produces a
// different, plausible config and answers a question nobody asked.
//
// The moved sub-test is doing a second job now: it is the only executable
// statement of where the #8752 fold STOPS. If the fold is later widened to
// `nat source rule-set`, this cell goes red and the person widening it has to
// choose a still-unfolded container deliberately, rather than discovering
// later that the trap became undetectable.
