// #9416: the NAMED spelling of the SNMP source-IP restriction, and the census
// that found the sixth spelling behind the fifth.
//
// THE DEFECT. Junos expresses one control two ways:
//
//	snmp { community c { clients 10.0.0.0/8; } }                       inline
//	snmp { client-list L { 10.0.0.0/8; }
//	       community c { client-list-name L; } }                       named
//
// Only the inline one was modelled. `client-list` and `client-list-name`
// appeared NOWHERE in pkg/config or pkg/snmp, and the SNMP compiler descends
// only into keywords it recognises, so the named form committed clean on all
// four channels (SchemaValidate, CompileConfig, CompileConfigLenient,
// configstore.CheckText) with zero warnings, compiled to an EMPTY allowlist,
// and `AllowsSource` documents an empty allowlist as ALLOW-ALL. The operator
// authored an access restriction and got an agent that answers every source,
// with nothing anywhere saying so.
//
// WHY IT SURVIVED FIVE FIXES. The inline sibling has had this exact fail-open
// repaired five times -- #4289 (the restriction was ignored outright), #5472
// (a duplicate community block overwrote the map and emptied the allowlist),
// #5833 (a `restrict` typo left allow-all instead of quarantining), #5898 (an
// orphan `restrict` was dropped, degrading deny-except to allow), #8778 (the
// one-line `set` spelling dropped the allowlist entirely) -- and every one of
// them assumed the restriction is spelled INLINE. A defect family whose members
// keep arriving is a signal about the SEARCH, not about the members.
//
// SO THE FAMILY WAS CENSUSED BEFORE THE FIFTH WAS FIXED, and there is a sixth:
//
//	community c { routing-instance ri { clients 10.0.0.0/8; } }        per-RI
//	community c { routing-instance ri { client-list-name L; } }        per-RI, named
//
// Measured on `configstore.CheckText` at the parent of this change: ACCEPT,
// zero warnings, `Clients=[]`, and `AllowsSource(203.0.113.9) == true` -- the
// same fail-open, one level deeper. It is handled here rather than left for a
// seventh pass: the source restriction inside a `routing-instance` block is
// APPLIED to the community (leaving it out means allow-all, which is strictly
// worse than applying it on the wrong instance), while the SCOPING itself --
// which xpf's single-socket, instance-unaware agent cannot honour -- is named
// in a commit advisory instead of being silently ignored.
//
// The remaining SNMP source-restriction axes are DIFFERENT controls, not more
// spellings of this one, and they are named by snmpInertKnobWarnings rather
// than implemented here: `snmp interface` / `filter-interfaces` (restrict by
// arrival interface), `snmp routing-instance-access` (restrict by instance),
// and `community <c> logical-system` (xpf has no logical systems at all).

// parseSNMPClientListPrefixes extracts a `client-list <name> { ... }` body,
// across both parser AST shapes (the #2419 dual-shape class).
//
// The node's own Keys carry `["client-list", "<name>", <prefix>...]` in the
// flat/bracketed spelling and `["client-list", "<name>"]` in the braced one,
// where the prefixes are Children. Keys[2:] is therefore the prefix run and
// Keys[1] is the list NAME -- reading from Keys[1] would silently make the list
// name its own first prefix, which parseClientPrefix would reject as malformed
// and which would quarantine every referencing community.
//
// The `<prefix> [restrict]` pairing is delegated to parseSNMPClients, NOT
// reimplemented, so the #5898 orphan-`restrict` fail-closed behaviour and the
// #5833 malformed-token quarantine reach the named list identically to the
// inline one. A named list is where a `restrict` typo is MORE dangerous, not
// less: one list backs every community that references it.

		// the operator configured correctly. That is fail-closed rather than
		// fail-open, but it rejects a valid config, so the bound is real work
		// and not belt-and-braces: expandFlatRun splits such a run before this
		// reader sees it, and this backstops the case where it cannot.
		//
		// `nodeVal` rather than a bare Keys[1] because it is this compiler's
		// SSOT for a single-valued leaf across BOTH AST slots: Keys[1] when the
		// value sits on the node, the first child's name when a spelling put it
		// in a block. Using it makes every spelling of this leaf agree on ONE
		// value — the alternative, reading Keys[1] AND every child, made the

		// adopted it as a SECOND list reference, so the same leaf was a scalar
