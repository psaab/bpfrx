// RETH redundancy-group ownership — the single source of truth for "does this
// interface own a chassis-cluster redundancy group?" (#6781).
//
// The question has one right answer and, before this file, had two wrong ones.
// Consumers split into two camps, and BOTH were measurably wrong, in OPPOSITE
// directions:
//
//	RedundancyGroup > 0 alone            (pkg/vrrp CollectRethInstances)
//	RedundancyGroup > 0 && name "reth*"  (everyone else)
//
// Measured on configs that COMMIT CLEANLY today:
//
//	`ge-0/0/5 redundant-ether-options redundancy-group 1`, nothing naming it as
//	a redundant-parent. The RG-only reading synthesizes a VRRP instance on it
//	whose "VIPs" are that interface's OWN unit addresses — so the node ADDS
//	them on MASTER and DELETES them on BACKUP, stripping a plain interface's
//	configured address. The name reading excludes it. Over-inclusion, harmful.
//
//	`bond0 redundant-ether-options redundancy-group 1` with
//	`ge-0/0/1 gigether-options redundant-parent bond0` — a STRUCTURALLY valid
//	redundant pair whose owner is not named "reth*". The RG-only reading
//	resolves it correctly to the physical member; the name reading returns
//	NOTHING, so the direct ownership mode installs no VIPs at all and the group
//	is dark. Under-inclusion, an outage.
//
// So the fix is not to make one camp match the other — that would ship one of
// the two defects everywhere. The discriminator both readings miss is
// STRUCTURAL: a redundant-ethernet interface is the L3 owner of a pair of
// member PORTS, and what makes it one is that ports name it
// (`gigether-options redundant-parent <name>`), not how it is spelled.
// RethToPhysical already keys on exactly that relation, and the whole runtime
// resolves a RETH to its local member through it — an interface absent from
// that map has no netdev for VRRP to bind, no member to fail over between, and
// nothing for a VIP to move onto.
//
// Naming is NOT used as the test, deliberately. Interface names are validated
// by character class only (validate_interface_name.go), so "reth" is a
// convention rather than a closed namespace, and rejecting an odd-named but
// structurally valid pair would turn a working config into a failed commit with
// no operator workaround — the #6564 lesson that file already records.
//
// validateRethRedundancyGroupStrict rejects the over-inclusion shape at commit;
// this predicate makes every runtime consumer agree on the answer.

// RethRGOwners returns interface name -> redundancy-group id for every
// interface that is a REDUNDANT-ETHERNET INTERFACE — either STRUCTURALLY (some
// port names it as its `gigether-options redundant-parent`) or NOMINALLY (it is
// spelled `reth*`) — mapped to the redundancy group it carries.
//
// It deliberately does NOT filter on `RedundancyGroup > 0`. That term belongs
// to the CALLER, because the two ownership modes need different things from it:
// the VRRP-backed collector synthesizes instances only for groups above 0,
// while the direct collector is legitimately queried FOR group 0 and must
// answer for a reth carrying it. Folding `> 0` in here silently broke the
// second. What the RG-0 query actually needs protecting from is every
// unconfigured interface DEFAULTING to 0 — and the structural/nominal test
// above already excludes those, since a fabric, control, or management
// interface is neither a reth by name nor by membership. That is the guard the
// replaced `strings.HasPrefix(name, "reth")` filter was really providing.
//
// The predicate is deliberately the UNION of the two readings it replaces,
// minus their shared blind spot. That direction matters: it EXCLUDES only the
// shape that was actively wrong (a redundancy group on an interface that is
// neither, which one mode half-applied and the other ignored) and INCLUDES the
// shape one mode was wrongly dropping (a structurally valid pair not spelled
// `reth*`, which the direct mode left with no VIPs at all). No configuration
// that either mode previously owned stops being owned — in HA ownership code a
// newly-excluded interface is an outage, so the nominal term is kept even
// though a `reth*` with no members yet is an incomplete config: both modes
// accepted it before, and narrowing that is not what #6781 is about.
//
// Build it ONCE per walk and look names up in it; it is O(interfaces) and
// recomputes RethToPhysical on each call. Present-but-nil interface slots are
// skipped (#6780).
