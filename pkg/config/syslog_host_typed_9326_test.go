// #9326: `security log stream <s> host` was an UNTYPED schema leaf — `args: 1`,
// no valueType, no validator — so any string an operator typed was carried
// straight to `net.Dial`'s resolver on the commit path, including one that is
// not a hostname at all.
//
// The dial is now deferred for TCP/TLS and bounded for UDP, so this leaf is no
// longer the only thing between a typo and a stalled commit. It is the half
// that returns the error where the operator can act on it — at commit, naming
// the leaf — rather than as a resolver failure logged later from a background
// warm.
