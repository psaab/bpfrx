// Issue 8867: SchemaValidate walked the UN-NORMALIZED tree, so a typed leaf
// authored in the packed spelling reached commit with no validation at all.
// The compiler normalizes the same pairs and therefore COMPILES their values,
// so the value took effect while its validator never ran.
//
// Measured before the fix, over the validator-bearing typed leaves reachable at
// a pair admitted to compactNormalizeInScope:
//
//	161 leaves: 146 rejected braced and ACCEPTED packed, 15 validated on both
//
// The 15 are why this is a claim about the packed path and not about
// validation in general.

// packedValidation8867 pairs a braced spelling with the packed spelling of the
// same statement. Both must reach the same verdict.

// THE NEGATIVE CONTROL, NAMED. The census found 15 of 161 leaves already
// validated in BOTH spellings, and that number is what makes the finding a
// claim about the packed path rather than about validation in general. Left as
// a bare count it is asserted rather than auditable, so here they are — every
// one a leaf under an arg-taking named-instance container, which is the shape
// whose packed statement the walk could already reach:
//
//	interface dead-interval        interface hello-interval
//	interface interface-type       interface priority
//	interface retransmit-interval  nat-prefix lifetime
//	nat64prefix lifetime           prefix preferred-lifetime
//	prefix valid-lifetime          qualified-next-hop preference
//	route preference               shaping-rate burst-size
//	static-binding fixed-address   transport protocol
//	unit vlan-id
//
// A reader can re-derive the split by running the census in the issue rather
// than taking 146/15 on trust.
//
// AND THE COUNT IS NOT COMPARABLE TO ITS NEIGHBOURS, which is how a reader
// mistakes one for another. Three different predicates of the same order:
//
//	311  validators ARMED per the #8853 inert-validator ratchet, counted
//	     against isTypedLeaf() on the BRACED path — it counts neither path's
//	     behaviour on the packed spelling
//	182  admitted pairs carrying a validator (lane-8526's predicate)
//	161  validator-bearing typed leaves reachable at an admitted pair, of
//	     which 146 were bypassable (this cell's predicate)
//
// None of the three is a subset of another by construction.

// A cfg/refs-dependent validator is where folding is most likely to change
// behaviour, because collectSchemaRefs runs on the tree AFTER normalization:
// a definition authored in the packed spelling could start satisfying a
// reference that previously failed. Measured, with a live control — it does
// NOT, because `class-of-service forwarding-classes` is not an admitted pair,
// so the definition is still dropped and rejecting the reference stays
// consistent with the compile.
//
// The control is the point. Without the "no definition" row, three "accepted"
// results would be indistinguishable from a validator that never fired — which
// is exactly what the first version of this probe did, using a path with no
// treeValidator on it at all.
