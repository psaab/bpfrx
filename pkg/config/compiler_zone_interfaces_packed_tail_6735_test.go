// Tests for #6735: a `security zones security-zone <z> interfaces` member whose
// Keys carry `host-inbound-traffic` with FURTHER TOKENS AFTER IT.
//
// The lexer strips brackets (#2419), so these two statements are structurally
// identical by the time the compiler sees them:
//
//	interfaces [ ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic ge-0/0/1.0 ];   // member list
//	interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ssh;  // packed body
//
// and their readings DISAGREE about zone membership. zoneInterfaceKeysBeforeBody
// truncates at the keyword, so the first silently loses member `ge-0/0/1.0` —
// a valid, defined interface the operator put in this zone, left with Zone == ""
// so the dataplane never binds it and no policy naming the zone applies to its
// traffic — and the second silently loses the whole override. The #6525
// non-empty belt cannot see the first: one member survived, so the stanza is not
// empty.
//
// The resolution is refusal, not a guess: reject at commit, warn on the tolerant
// path, and point the operator at the block spelling, which is unambiguous.

// zonePackedTailConfig wraps a zone stanza in a config that DEFINES both
// interfaces the tests reference, so a rejection can only come from the gate
// under test and never from the zone-interface-DEFINED gate.

// That ordering was previously unbound. Both gates return a non-nil error for
// this shape, so every test asserting only "rejected" — including the one in
// this file — stayed green with the two swapped, and the operator silently got
// the worse message. Worse, the packed-tail message happens to CONTAIN the zone,
// the keyword and the dropped token, so even asserting those three does not
// separate the gates: the non-empty message renders the same tokens via
// zoneInterfaceStanzaTokens.
//
// So this asserts on each gate's distinguishing clause, in BOTH directions:
// the overlap shape must carry the packed-tail reason and NOT the non-empty
// reason, and a genuinely empty stanza must carry the non-empty reason and NOT
// the packed-tail one. The second half is what stops a "fix" that simply makes
// the packed-tail gate swallow everything.
//
// Fail-on-revert, measured: swap the two gate invocations in
// compiler_uniformgates_cluster_zone.go and the failure set across the whole
// package is exactly this test's overlap subtest — an assertion, not a build
// break, and nothing else in pkg/config reds. That makes this the assertion
// that binds the order.
//
// SCOPE — read this before "strengthening" it. What is observed is the rendered
// REASON TEXT, not which function produced it. An overbroad packed-tail gate
// that also swallowed the empty-member shapes and rendered the non-empty reason
// for them would satisfy both directions here and pass. That is deliberate: the
// operator-visible message is the contract, so a refactor that keeps every
// rendered result identical is legitimate however the helpers are arranged. Do
// NOT read this test as pinning which helper ran, and do not add an assertion
// that tries to — it would convert a behavioural contract into a structural one.
