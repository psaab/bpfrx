// #9408: `protocols ospf reference-bandwidth` — the Junos bandwidth grammar,
// its unit, and the conversion to what FRR can actually render.
//
// THE UNITS DIFFER, and that is the whole content of this file.
//
//   - Junos `[edit protocols ospf] reference-bandwidth` is BITS PER SECOND.
//     Its range is 9 600 .. 100 000 000 000 000 bits/s and its default is
//     100 Mbps (100 000 000 bits/s). Junos accepts the plain integer form and
//     the k/m/g suffix form, exactly like every other Junos bandwidth leaf
//     (which is why this leaf is typed `ValueRate` — the type's own doc
//     comment already says "bits/sec with k/m/g suffix").
//   - FRR's `auto-cost reference-bandwidth (1-4294967)` is MEGABITS PER
//     SECOND.
//
// Before #9408 the leaf was untyped and the compiler stored the operator's
// token with a bare `strconv.Atoi` whose error was DISCARDED. Two things
// followed, both silent:
//
//  1. Every suffixed spelling — `1g`, `100m`, the forms Junos documentation
//     and every worked example use — failed `Atoi`, compiled to 0, and
//     rendered NO `auto-cost` line at all. The operator's cost basis stayed
//     at FRR's default and nothing said so. `-5` behaved the same way.
//  2. The bare-integer spelling was passed through VERBATIM into an FRR
//     directive whose unit is Mbps, so a Junos-faithful value was three to
//     six orders of magnitude too large for the grammar it was written into.
//
// This file is the single source of truth for the leaf: both the commit-time
// validator (`ValidateOSPFReferenceBandwidth`, wired on the `setSchema` leaf)
// and the compiler (`compileProtocols`) call `ospfReferenceBandwidthMbps`, so
// the gate and the value cannot drift apart in either direction — a schema
// behind the compiler drops values, a compiler behind the schema accepts what
// the gate rejected.
//
// SEMANTIC CHANGE, stated plainly rather than buried: a bare integer now means
// BITS PER SECOND, not Mbps. `reference-bandwidth 10000` used to render
// `auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000` (10 Gbps); it now names 10 kbps, which
// FRR cannot express, and is REJECTED at commit with a message naming the
// unit. That is a loud failure on the commit path and a warning-plus-FRR-
// default on the tolerant load / HA-sync path (SchemaValidate violations are
// downgraded to warnings by configstore.compileTreeLenient), so an
// already-persisted config boots rather than blacking out — it just boots on
// FRR's default cost basis instead of a value three orders of magnitude wrong.
