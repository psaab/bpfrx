// #7924: overlapping L3 across routing-instances is only a LIVE cross-tenant
// bypass when a PBR `then routing-instance` term is steering. The established-
// session fast path short-circuits before `ingress_route_table_override`, so a
// second flow sharing a 5-tuple inherits the first flow's cached egress, NAT and
// POLICY decision across the tenant boundary — but nothing re-homes a flow's
// table without that term.
//
// So the rejection is NARROW, and this table is what proves it is narrow rather
// than broad. The MIDDLE ROW is the whole point: overlap with NO PBR must still
// commit. Delete the PBR half of the condition and only that row reds — without
// it a broad reject passes as a narrow one, and a broad reject would break the
// overlapping-address-space designs VRFs exist to serve.
