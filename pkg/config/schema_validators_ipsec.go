// ValidateDHGroup accepts a Diffie-Hellman group as either a bare integer

// configured in the wild and both compile (compiler_ipsec.go strips the
// "group" prefix then Atoi's the remainder). The group number must be a
// positive integer: the compiler leaves DHGroup at 0 on a parse failure,
// and a 0/garbage group silently drops the modp term from the swanctl
// proposal (pkg/ipsec/ipsec.go buildIKEProposal / buildESPProposal gate on
// DHGroup > 0), so an invalid value commits and then quietly weakens the
// negotiated proposal. This validator closes that silent-drop while staying
// faithful to the two spellings the compiler already accepts.
