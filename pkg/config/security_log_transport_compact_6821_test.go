// security_log_transport_compact_6821_test.go — #6821.
//
// `security log stream <s> transport` has two legal hierarchical spellings, and
// the compiler read only one of them:
//
//	transport { protocol tls; }   Keys=[transport]            children=2
//	transport protocol tls;       Keys=[transport protocol tls] children=0
//
// The second packs its value onto the container's own Keys, so a
// `prop.Children` loop ran ZERO times and left `Transport.Protocol` empty on a
// config that committed cleanly. `daemon_system.go` defaults an empty protocol
// to "udp", so the compact spelling of a TLS audit stream shipped over
// PLAINTEXT UDP.
//
// The fix could not be "read Keys[1:] too" on its own, and that is the part
// worth keeping straight. The gate ignores a container's packed tail BY DESIGN
// — compiler-faithful, since no compiler read it — so compiling the tail
// without teaching the gate turns "not compiled" into "compiled, UNVALIDATED".
// Measured on master before the fix: `transport { protocol tpc; }` was rejected
// by the enum while `transport protocol tpc;` was ACCEPTED. So the schema node
// now sets `packedTail: true`, the walker validates the same expansion
// `packedBodyChildren` hands the compiler, and the #3350 tls-profile check reads
// it too. Three readers, one expansion.
