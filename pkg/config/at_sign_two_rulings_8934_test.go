// TestAtSignRulingsAreOppositeOnPurpose8934 pins two rulings about `@` that
// were made the same day, in opposite directions, on different surfaces.
//
//	#8924  an SSH algorithm name MAY contain `@`  (aes256-gcm@openssh.com)
//	#8934  a community LITERAL may NOT contain `@` (@evil)
//
// Both are correct and they are not in tension: OpenSSH's grammar includes `@`
// in algorithm names, and FRR's community-literal grammar does not. But nothing
// pinned them apart, and each looks like "the repo's position on `@`" when read
// alone. Without this cell the likely failure is not a regression but a
// well-meant CORRECTION: someone finds one ruling, reads it as the policy, and
// "fixes" the other to match.
//
// Asserting them together makes the asymmetry deliberate and legible, and reds
// if either half is changed to agree with the other.
