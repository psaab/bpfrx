// compiler_system_login_packed.go carries the #6662 commit-side gate for a
// `system login` body written on the statement line rather than in a nested
// block. Junos accepts both spellings; xpf compiles only the block (and the
// equivalent flat-`set`) form, so the packed spelling commits an EMPTY object:
//
//	system { login { user alice { class ops; } } }      -> Class = "ops"
//	system { login { user alice class ops; } }          -> Class = ""      <- dropped
//	system { login { class ops { permissions [ view configure ]; } } }
//	                                                    -> Permissions = [view configure]
//	system { login { class ops permissions [ view configure ]; } }
//	                                                    -> Permissions = []  <- dropped
//	system { login { user alice { authentication ssh-rsa "..."; } } }
//	                                                    -> SSHKeys = []      <- dropped
//
// The mechanism is the one documented in docs/config-schema.md ("Packed
// statements"): `namedInstances` resolves the instance NAME across both AST
// shapes (it reads Keys[1]) but hands the node back with the body still on
// Keys, and the login compiler then walks `.Children`, which is empty. One
// level down, `authentication` is the only login body statement the compiler
// reads exclusively through `.Children`, so its inline spelling drops the same
// way. Flat-set (`ParseSetCommand` + `SetPath`) is unaffected in every case:
// the schema consumes exactly the instance name as the keyed arg and hangs the
// rest off as children. The exposure is hand-authored hierarchical config text
// and `load override` — precisely how a vSRX config is migrated.
//
// WHY REJECT RATHER THAN UNPACK. Every downstream safety net in this stanza is
// guarded on NON-EMPTINESS, so an empty compile silences the whole belt:
//
//   - an empty user class means pkg/cli's `c.userClass == ""`, which is the
//     DELIBERATE legacy "no RBAC configured" shortcut — checkPermission returns
//     nil (allow everything) and showConfigRedacted returns false (cleartext
//     PSKs, SNMP communities, authentication-keys). The shortcut is correct;
//     the defect is that a config WITH RBAC configured reaches it. That
//     compounds with the #6701 identity fix in the permissive direction, which
//     is why the two ship together;
//   - an empty class permission set maps to the coarse `{none}` bucket, and the
//     `deny-commands` / `deny-configuration` advisory at
//     loginClassAdvisoryWarnings is guarded on `lc.DenyCommands != ""` — the
//     very warning that tells the operator the class is MORE PERMISSIVE than
//     the Junos source never fires, because the field the bug dropped is the
//     one the guard reads;
//   - a dropped `authentication` block leaves the account with no key and no
//     password.
//
// Unpacking would have to be exactly right for every leaf to avoid minting a
// wrong-but-non-empty class, which is worse than an empty one. Rejecting is
// unambiguous and both accepted spellings (nested block, flat `set`) already
// work, so the operator has a mechanical rewrite.
//
// Strictness follows the sibling AST gates: hard-reject at commit /
// commit-check, downgrade to a cfg.Warnings entry on the tolerant load /
// peer-sync paths (#1960 no-brick) so a node that persisted such a config under
// an older binary still BOOTS — leniently loaded, the stanza stays as inert as
// it already was, now with the drop stated.
//
// BOTH-NODE EVALUATION (#6706 review blocker). Both gates below run
// PRE-EXPANSION and evaluate the effective view of EVERY cluster node (the
// node0 AND node1 `${node}`/apply-groups expansions), exactly like the sibling
// union gates validateQinQVLANStackAST (#5879) and validateVLANMapAST (#6178).
// Evaluating only the committing node's view left both gates fully bypassable:
//
//	groups {
//	    node1 { system { login {
//	        class super-user { permissions view; }
//	        user bob { class super-user; }
//	    } } }
//	}
//	apply-groups "${node}";
//
// Committed on node 0, the node-1 body is stripped by ExpandGroupsWithVars
// before either gate sees anything, so strict commit-check passes. The peer
// then ingests the config through Store.SyncApply, which is the TOLERANT path
// (compileTreeLenient) and only warns. On node 1 the stanza is live, and
// pkg/cli resolveClassPerms resolves the built-in `super-user` first — bob
// holds PermAll, and the authored `permissions view` narrowing that the
// operator read as restrictive never applied on either node. The origin commit
// is the only strict check the peer view ever gets, so it has to run here; that
// is the same argument compiler_peer_effective_snat.go makes for source NAT
// (#5876), applied at the AST layer these gates live in rather than on a
// compiled *Config.
//
// Only the two per-node effective views are unioned — deliberately NOT the
// pre-expansion all-groups "View 1" that the COLLISION-shaped union gates
// (validateZoneIDCollisionAST, validateInterfaceUnitAliasCollisionsAST #5878)
// also fold in. Both login gates trip on a SINGLE property, so a View-1 union
// would additionally reject a packed or shadowing body staged in a group that
// no `apply-groups` references — inert dead config that renders on no node.
// TestLoginPackedInsideAppliedGroupRejected_6662 pins that unapplied groups
// stay inert.

// loginInstanceKeywords is the set of `system login` NAMED INSTANCES, i.e. the
// keywords under `login` that take an identity argument and a body. It is the
// full child set of the `login` schema node (schema_system.go); `login` has no
// other children, so the enumeration below is the whole stanza.

// writing the body inline on the statement line drops it.
//
// Derived by reading compiler_system.go's `login` arm against the `login`
// schema node, statement by statement. The full body vocabulary and its
// classification:
//
//	class <name>:
//	  permissions          multi-value leaf -> firewallMatchValues reads Keys[1:]
//	                       AND Children and accumulates (#2419) — inline is FINE
//	  idle-timeout         leaf -> nodeVal handles both shapes — FINE
//	  allow-commands       leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  deny-commands        leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  allow-configuration  leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  deny-configuration   leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  login-alarms         flag, no compiler arm at all in EITHER shape (a
//	                       pre-existing accept-but-ignore gap, not a packed
//	                       drop) — not this gate's business
//	  login-tip            flag, same as login-alarms
//
//	user <name>:
//	  uid                  leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  class                leaf -> nodeVal — FINE
//	  authentication       BLOCK ONLY -> the compiler ranges over prop.Children
//	                       for encrypted-password / ssh-ed25519 / ssh-rsa /
//	                       ssh-dsa and never looks at Keys — inline DROPS
//
// So `authentication` is the only entry. It is a map rather than a hardcoded
// check so adding a block-bodied login statement is a one-line change here, and
// TestLoginBlockOnlyStatementsAreSchemaChildren_6662 fails if a name listed
// here is not a real schema child (a typo would silently disable the gate).
//
// The VALUE is the statement's ARITY: how many tokens after the keyword
// legitimately belong to its key rather than being a packed body. `authentication`
// takes none, so anything after the keyword is a packed body. A future
// block-bodied statement that DOES take an argument (`foo <name> { ... }`,
// schema `args: 1`) would carry that argument on Keys in the correct nested
// spelling too, so the packed test has to be `len(Keys) > 1 + arity` rather
// than `> 1` — otherwise the gate would reject the very spelling it is meant to
// accept. Recording the arity here keeps that correct by construction instead of
// leaving an args-bearing block statement outside the guard's scope (#6701
