//
// The fourth filed instance, #6817 (`system login user ... authentication`), is

// TestPackedTailAttachesOnlyWhereTheGrammarPermitsABody_6818 pins the guard on

// The helper attaches a node's real children UNDER the deepest node of the
// expanded packed tail, which is what the grammar means for

// the terminal is a LEAF: `stanza leaf value { body }` describes no nesting the

//
// # Why this drives the helper rather than a compile
//
// It used to go through CompileConfig on a packed source, which made it a test
// of "does this packed config compile correctly" rather than of the helper's
// contract. That is the wrong subject twice over:
//
//   - it tested the guard only via whichever callers happen to reach it today,
//     so a new direct caller of packedBodyChildren was never covered;
//   - and it is fragile to anything that rewrites the tree BEFORE the compiler
//     runs. #2419's whole-tree normalizer does exactly that, and with it in
//     place the compiler never sees a packed tail at all — the cell would pass
//     while testing nothing, or fail for a reason unrelated to the guard.
//
// The guard is a property of packedBodyChildren. Test it there, and it holds
// for every caller regardless of what runs upstream.
// packedTailSchemaPaths is the SINGLE source of the schema paths the cells
// below address.
//

// on a nil result, so a cell CANNOT run against a path that does not resolve.
// The previous shape kept the paths as literals in each cell and re-spelled
// them a second time in a "do these resolve?" control, which is two independent
// copies of a fact that must agree: editing a cell's literal left the control
// checking the OLD path and still passing. That is how
// `firewall/family/filter/term/from` — missing the address family, therefore
// nil — went unnoticed while the cell using it was green against a helper that
