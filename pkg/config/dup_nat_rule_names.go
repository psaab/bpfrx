// natRuleSubBlocks lists the NAT sub-blocks whose rule-sets carry named,
// ordered, first-match rules. Keep in sync with compileNAT
// (compiler_nat_source.go), which iterates exactly these sub-blocks and whose
// per-type compilers read `rule-set` -> `rule` with namedInstances. nat64 /
// natv6v4 / proxy-arp are intentionally excluded: they carry no name-derived
// first-match rule identity of this shape.

// dupNATRule is one detected duplicate rule name within a single NAT rule-set.
type dupNATRule struct {
	natType string // "source" | "destination" | "static"
	ruleSet string // the rule-set that owns the duplicated rule
	rule    string // the duplicated rule name
}

// validateDuplicateNATRuleNamesAST rejects (strict) or warns (lenient) when the
// candidate authors the SAME rule name twice inside one NAT rule-set.
//
// A NAT rule-set is keyed by rule name and is an ordered first-match table, so
// the same name authored twice is a config error regardless of NAT type: both
// instances compile as separate first-match entries sharing one operational
// identity (the rule name). For source / destination / ordinary static NAT
// those are counted rows on the shared natType/ruleset/rule hit counter
// (pkg/dataplane/compiler_nat.go NATCounterKey); for a counter-less NPTv6 (RFC
// 6296) static rule they are two snapshots (buildNptv6Snapshots appends each,
// pkg/dataplane/userspace/nat_nptv6.go). The reason line is deliberately
// type-agnostic: it never claims a per-rule counter (an NPTv6 rule has none —
// compileStaticNAT skips rule.IsNPTv6 before assignNATCounterID) and does not
// assert runtime shadowing for disjoint prefixes. The genuine, type-independent
// defect is the shared name identity. (Overlapping NPTv6 prefixes are rejected
// separately by the #2241 overlap gate; that gate SKIPS same-(rule-set, rule)
// pairs (#4339, so a multi-from-scope rule is not flagged against itself),
// which is exactly why THIS duplicate-name gate is the only one that catches a
// same-named NPTv6 pair.)
//
// This is a DIFFERENT failure mode from #5180's last-writer-wins hierarchical
// blocks: duplicate NAT rules BOTH survive. Runs PRE-expansion on top-level
// `security` stanzas only, exactly like validateDuplicateNamedBlockAST (#5180):
// apply-groups DEEP-MERGES a rule of the same name rather than duplicating it, and
// a rule authored once via flat `set` reuses its rule node, so only hierarchical
// duplicates authored directly reach here. The seen-set is keyed by (natType,
// ruleSet, rule) and unioned across repeated `security` / `nat` /
// `source|destination|static` blocks — compileNAT (#3915) merges those repeats —
// so a rule name split across two `source {}` blocks is caught too. A quoted-empty
// rule name is recorded as an empty-name defect (#6455) rather than skipped; an
// empty rule-SET name is NOT reported here (the #6454 rule-set gate owns it, so
// the warning is not double-reported) — this gate skips an empty rule-set. Strict
// rejects on the operator commit / commit-check path; lenient (Load / peer-sync,
// #1960) warns and keeps the historical two-row behavior.
//
// A duplicate authored ENTIRELY inside an applied group body is not caught here
// — this gate is pre-expansion by design. It is caught by
// validateDuplicateNamesExpandedAST (dup_names_expanded_6455.go, #6455
// Finding 1), which re-runs THIS function on a group-expanded clone.
