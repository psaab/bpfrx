// #4785 half 1: `tunnel mode ipip` must be REJECTED at commit / commit-check.
//
// IPIP has no userspace dataplane primitive in either direction — an endpoint
// is entered into gre_decap_index only when tunnel_mode_kind() == TunnelKind::Gre,
// and TunnelKind::Unknown is the egress dispatcher's fail-closed drop arm — so
// the tunnel is created, comes UP, and passes no traffic at all. It previously
// committed green with only the #4788 advisory. This file replaces
// ipip_tunnel_dead_warn_4788_test.go: the advisory is now the gate's
// lenient-path warning, and the strict path errors.
//
// Both severities are pinned here, because a gate that rejects everywhere would
// brick the boot of a node whose ALREADY-COMMITTED config carries an IPIP
// stanza — the #1960 no-brick class covers a load that succeeds while revoking
// something, and it equally covers a load that refuses outright.
