// #8939 on the RBAC surface. `system login class <name>` dropped every leaf
// after the first of a flat `set` command:
//
//	set system login class ops allow-commands "a" allow-configuration "c"
//	  -> allow-commands="a"  allow-configuration=""
//
// THE LOST VALUE IS NOT THE WHOLE LOSS. compiler_system.go also records leaf
// PRESENCE into LoginClass.AllowLeavesPresent, and #7172's loginRegexesFor
// keys enforcement on presence, not value:
//
//	if !allowSet && !denySet { return CompiledLoginRegexes{}, false, nil }
//
// with the caller contract stated in that file -- "callers MUST skip
// evaluation entirely". An allow regex is an ALLOWLIST. So dropping
// `allow-configuration` does not narrow the class to an empty allowlist, it
// removes the family's rule ALTOGETHER and the class keeps everything
// `permissions` grants. The loss direction is toward MORE authority.
//
// REACHABILITY IS A PROPERTY OF THE LEAF THE RUN STARTS AT, NOT OF THE
// CONTAINER -- measured on the FLAT-SET tree through the same pair
// compileTreeStrict runs (schemaValidateExpandedTree then CompileConfig), not
// on a hierarchical transcription, which is a DIFFERENT AST shape that #8437's
// fused-statement guard already catches and which `CheckText` cannot express.
//
//	login class:  allow-commands "x" idle-timeout 30  -> ACCEPTED
//	login class:  idle-timeout 30 allow-commands "x"  -> SCHEMA-REJECT
//	ike gateway:  address A external-interface E      -> ACCEPTED
//	ike gateway:  version v2-only address A           -> SCHEMA-REJECT
//
// Same container, same two statements, opposite verdicts by ORDER. A leaf that
// declares a type/validator (`idle-timeout` valueType 6, `version` valueType 8)
// routes to the typed-leaf branch, whose modifier-child check rejects the
// trailing tokens; an untyped args:1 leaf (`allow-commands`, `address`) falls
// through to the container branch, which by #3332's compiler-faithful contract
// DELIBERATELY ignores leftover Keys.
//
// So the earlier container-level reading -- "`class` is args:1 with children
// and no wildcard, therefore nothing under it is validated" -- is WRONG, and
// `idle-timeout` is the counterexample. What IS container-level is unknown-
// keyword blindness, a separate property:
//
//	set system login class ops bogus-token 5    -> ADMITTED
//	set system login user bob  bogus-token 5    -> ADMITTED
//	set security flow tcp-session bogus-token 5 -> rejected, closed world

// #7971 models `allow-commands-regexps` ONLY so it is REFUSED -- the family
// inverts allow/deny precedence, so accepting it under the plain family's
// semantics would silently weaken the restriction the operator wrote. That
// refusal is a keyValidator in the typed schema walk. Measured:
//
//	set … allow-commands "a"                      -> commits
//	set … allow-commands-regexps "b"              -> REFUSED (#7971)
//	set … allow-commands "a" allow-commands-regexps "b"  -> COMMITS
//
// The flat run nests the refused leaf under `allow-commands`, and because
// `class` is an args:1 instance container the walk never descends to it. The
// compiler-side fix above makes the leaf READ; it cannot make the walk REFUSE
// it, so a deliberate fail-closed refusal is still reachable-around by a
// spelling. Closing it means teaching the walk to descend into arg-modelled
// instance containers, which changes admission across every such container and
// is not smuggled into a compiler change.
//
// Asserted as the CURRENT state, deliberately: if someone closes the walk-side
// hole this cell goes red and points at itself, which is the correct outcome
// for a recorded gap.

// TestFlatRunLeavesMultiValueBlocksAlone8939 is the regression cell for a
// defect this change INTRODUCED and a shipped instrument caught.
//
// expandFlatRun originally hoisted EVERY child of a terminating leaf, on the
// reasoning that a leaf declaring no schema children can have no body, so
// anything nested under it must be the next link of the chain. That is false
// for a `multi` leaf, and #2419 had already said so: in the BLOCK spelling
//
//	permissions { view; configure; }
//
// the children are VALUES, not statements. Hoisting them turned a leaf that
// was READ into one that was not read at all.
//
// THE LOSER FIXTURE COULD NOT SEE IT. `system login class` was ALREADY on the
// loser list, so the row leaving looks like the fix working; a container that
// starts walking and simultaneously stops reading another leaf produces the
// same fixture delta as a clean fix. TestSchemaSpellingDifferentialGate caught
// it because it sweeps SIX spellings per leaf and reports per-spelling
// verdicts -- `A=keep B=inert C=keep D=keep E=keep F=drop` -- so a leaf read in
// one spelling and inert in another is visible as a disagreement rather than
// as an aggregate.
//
// The fix is to hoist only a child that RESOLVES as another leaf of the
// container. Every chain link begins with a keyword, so none is lost; every
// value list stays attached to the leaf that owns it. expandFlatRun also stops
// CUTTING a multi leaf's Keys, per #2419.
//
// THIS CELL BINDS THE PAIR, NOT EITHER HALF, and that is measured rather than
// assumed: removing the hoist gate alone leaves it green, removing the multi
// guard alone leaves it green, removing BOTH reproduces the original
// per-spelling signature exactly. `permissions` is both multi and
// block-spelled, so either guard clears it; the two diverge on leaves this
// container does not have. The matrix is in flat_run_scan.go beside the code
