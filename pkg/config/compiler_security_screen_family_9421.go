// Screen FAMILY-node packed-tail normalization — #9421.
//
// #6683 taught compileScreen to read the ids-option node's PACKED body:
//
//	ids-option s1 { icmp { ping-death; } }   nested   -> [ids-option s1]>[icmp]>[ping-death]
//	ids-option s1 icmp ping-death;           packed   -> [ids-option s1 icmp ping-death]
//
// It normalises the tail at ONE depth — `packedBody(inst.node, idsSchema)` —
// and the depth one level in was never swept. A FAMILY node (`icmp`, `ip`,
// `tcp`, `udp`, `limit-session`) that carries its own body packed onto its
// Keys arrives with ZERO children:
//
//	ids-option s1 { icmp ping-death; }              -> [icmp ping-death]
//	ids-option s1 { icmp [ ping-death fragment ]; } -> [icmp ping-death fragment]
//	ids-option s1 { tcp bogus-check; }              -> [tcp bogus-check]
//
// compileScreen iterates `icmpNode.Children`, so the loop body never runs: no
// flag is set, nothing reaches `ScreenProfile.UnknownLeaves`, and the #3318
// gate (validateScreenUnknownStrict) — which is armed ONLY from UnknownLeaves —
// never fires. The check compiles DISABLED on a commit that reported success.
//
// # The part that makes this hard to notice: three observables, two shapes
//
// The FLAT spelling of the identical statement does not lose it, because
// SetPath builds a CHAIN instead of packing onto one node
// (`[icmp]>[ping-death]>[fragment]`). Measured on master for
// `icmp [ ping-death fragment ]`:
//
//	shape          strict CompileConfig   ICMP.PingDeath   UnknownLeaves
//	hierarchical   ACCEPT                 false            []
//	flat set       REJECT (#1960 msg)     true (lenient)   [icmp ping-death fragment]
//
// One statement, two spellings, and they disagree on the verdict, on the
// compiled boolean AND on whether the gate is armed. A gate that fires in one
// AST shape only is a reachability defect independent of the lost flag.
//
// # Why this expands PAST the modelled grammar where packedBodyChildren stops
//
// `packedBodyChildren` (compact_tail.go) refuses to guess: the first tail token
// that is not a schema child of the previous one abandons the whole expansion
// and returns the node's real children. That is right for its callers, which
// have no backstop — inventing a shape the schema does not model would drop
// configuration a different way.
//
// Here there IS a backstop, and it is the point of the fix. Every token this
// walk cannot resolve lands as a node the family's `default:` arm (or
// recordKeyExtras / recordChildExtras) records on `UnknownLeaves`, so the
// commit is REJECTED with the same message the flat path already produces
// rather than silently accepted. Continuing the chain is therefore not a guess
// about meaning; it is what makes the unmodelled token VISIBLE. The shape built
// is exactly the one SetPath builds for the same tokens, which is why the two
// AST shapes come out byte-identical afterwards.
//
// This is a site-local normalization in compileScreen, deliberately NOT an
// admission into the `compact_normalize_scope.go` table: that table's stated
// safety precondition is that a site first appear in the measured
// `testdata/compact_block_divergences_2419.txt` inventory, and #9056 is the
// open issue that the inventory census cannot enumerate a valueless boolean
// flag at all. #9056 owns that general class (83 sites across the tree, of
// which the screen families are a handful) and stays open; this fixes the
// screen family depth at the reader.

// screenNormalizeFamilies returns body with every FAMILY child's packed tail
// expanded. The returned node is the ORIGINAL when nothing needed expanding
// (the overwhelmingly common nested spelling); otherwise it is a shallow copy,
// so the operator's AST is never mutated and `show configuration` still renders
// exactly what was typed.
