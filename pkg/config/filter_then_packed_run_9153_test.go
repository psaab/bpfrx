// #9153: a firewall-filter `then` clause written on ONE set line lost actions
// past the second, and when the lost one was the TERMINATING action the term
// fell through — a fail-open on a clean commit with zero warnings.
//
//	set ... term t1 then count c1 log discard
//	  -> action=""  count="c1"  log=true      the `discard` is GONE
//
// The tree explains it: SetPath builds the #8939 flat chain, and the last link
// carries a packed RUN on one node's Keys —
//
//	then > [count c1] > [log discard]
//
// flattenThenChain8939 hoists each nested node out of the chain but a node whose
// Keys are `[log discard]` is still ONE node, and compileFilterThen reads its
// first key and drops the rest. So the chain fix was necessary and not
// sufficient: hoisting moved the run without splitting it.
//
// EVERY CASE IS ASSERTED AGAINST THE SAME ACTIONS WRITTEN AS SEPARATE LINES,
// not against a hand-written expectation. That is what makes the cell resistant
// to being "fixed" by a levelling-down: a compiler that dropped the actions in
// both spellings would fail the reference check below, which requires the split
// form to actually produce the terminating action.
