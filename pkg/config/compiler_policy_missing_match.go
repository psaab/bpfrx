// compiler_policy_missing_match.go carries the #3044 reject-at-commit gate
// for a security policy whose `match` clause is MISSING one of the three
// mandatory Junos match dimensions — source-address, destination-address,
// or application — or that omits the `match` block entirely.
//
// The defect: Junos/vSRX requires every security policy `match` to specify
// all three core dimensions (source-address, destination-address, and
// application); a policy missing any of them is rejected at commit. xpf's
// policy compiler (compilePolicy in compiler_security.go) instead treats
// the whole `match` block — and every leaf within it — as OPTIONAL: the
// fields are filled only when matchNode != nil, and an absent
// source-address / destination-address / application simply leaves the
// corresponding slice empty. The userspace dataplane then interprets an
// empty slice as match-ANY (capabilities.go returns a nil app-term list
// for "no apps"; userspace-dp/src/policy.rs compiles an empty app list as
// match_any:true and defaults source/destination_*_match_any to true when
// the literal+book sets are empty). No commit-time validation requires the
// three dimensions.
//
// Why that is dangerous: a partial policy is SILENTLY BROADER than typed.
// `match source-address corp; then permit` permits `corp -> any:any`
// (every destination, every application); a policy with no `match` block
// at all becomes a zone-pair-wide permit (or deny). A single dropped line
// in an automation template widens a narrow rule to all traffic — a
// fail-OPEN for a permit policy, an over-broad block for a deny policy.
// On Junos this configuration cannot commit; on xpf it commits and ships
// a wildcard. Surfacing it (reject at commit) restores Junos parity and is
// the safe choice.
//
// Contract (Junos parity): the three dimensions are REQUIRED, and a
// missing dimension is treated DIFFERENTLY from an explicit wildcard. An
// operator who wants any-source / any-destination / any-application must
// write it explicitly — `match { source-address any; destination-address
// any; application any; }` — exactly as Junos demands. Only the absence of
// the leaf is rejected; `any` (or `any-ipv4` / `any-ipv6`, an address
// book name, a literal CIDR, a named application / application-set) all
// satisfy the requirement. `source-address-excluded` /
// `destination-address-excluded` are MODIFIERS of source/destination-
// address, not substitutes, so they do not by themselves satisfy the
// source-address / destination-address requirement (Junos requires the
// base address leaf alongside the excluded modifier).
//
// This is an AST pre-walk (not a SchemaValidate typed leaf, and not a
// typed-*Config validator) for the same reasons the #3113 unsupported-
// match-leaf gate (validatePolicyMatchLeavesStrict) is: a missing leaf
// leaves no trace in the typed *Config (the empty slice is
// indistinguishable from an explicit-any that also resolves to match-any),
// and SchemaValidate is opt-in per known leaf and cannot REJECT an absence.
// The walk runs on the group-expanded, inactive-pruned tree, so an
// apply-groups-inherited match dimension counts toward the requirement and
// an `inactive:` policy is ignored for free.
//
// Both zone-pair (`from-zone`/`to-zone`) and `global` policies are covered.
//
// Strict path (commit / commit-check, lenient=false): the first offending
// policy is a hard compile error naming the policy scope, the policy, and
// every missing dimension, directing the operator to add it (write `any`
// for an intentional wildcard).
//
// Lenient path (load / peer-sync, lenient=true): every offending policy is
// returned as a warning and compilation continues — an already-persisted
// or peer-synced config that an older binary silently accepted still BOOTS
// (#1960 fail-closed-on-load class). The policy keeps its pre-existing
// match-any-for-missing compilation exactly as before this gate, now
// flagged. Same doctrine as validatePolicyMatchLeavesStrict.
//
// #6526 extends the file to the SECOND way a dimension can fail to constrain
// anything: a dimension written with NO OPERAND (`source-address;`, or a
// `set ... match source-address` line with the value left off). The gate above
// decides presence from the leaf NAME, so a valueless leaf satisfied it while
// compiling to the byte-identical empty match-ANY slice the omitted form
// produces — the reject gate protected a claim about VALUES with a check on
// NAMES. policyValuelessMatchDimensions closes that by asking
// firewallMatchValues (the SAME reader compilePolicy uses) whether the
// dimension carries anything, and covers all FIVE value-bearing dimensions:
// source-address, destination-address, application, plus the scoped-global
// from-zone / to-zone (whose empty set collapses a global policy to the
// all-zones wildcard). Same strict-reject / lenient-warn doctrine, and both
// findings feed compilePolicy's #5575 LenientContentDropped poison so a
// leniently-loaded valueless policy is published as never-match rather than as
// a silently widened permit.

// requiredPolicyMatchLeaves are the three Junos-mandatory match dimensions
// every active security policy must specify. Kept in declaration order so
// the error message lists missing dimensions deterministically.

// compilePolicy's #5575 fail-closed LenientContentDropped flag, so the reject
// gate and the runtime poison decision can never diverge on which policies omit

//
// #3842: it unions the dimensions across EVERY `match {}` block
// (policyMatchChildren), not just the first via FindChild. Junos merges
// duplicate match blocks, so a policy whose required dimensions are split
// across two blocks (e.g. source/destination-address in one, application in a
// load-merged second) is complete once merged — a FindChild-first read saw only
// the first block and would either spuriously flag a complete policy or,

// `security policies global` policy so the global-only from-zone/to-zone match
// context is inspected exactly where compilePolicy honours it.
//
// #6526 — the defect this closes. policyMissingRequiredMatchDimensions above
// decides presence from the leaf NAME (`present[m.Name()] = true`), while the
// reader compilePolicy actually uses — firewallMatchValues
// (compiler_firewall.go) — SKIPS blank tokens, and its own doc comment states
// the conflicting definition: "an empty result means criterion absent". A leaf
// written with NO operand therefore satisfies the #3044 name-based gate and
// compiles to the BYTE-IDENTICAL empty slice the omitted form produces:
//
//	match { source-address; destination-address any; application any; }
//	set security policies from-zone t to-zone u policy p1 match source-address
//
// both yield Match.SourceAddresses == [] (n=0), which the userspace matcher
// reads as match-ANY — so `then permit` permits EVERY source. The same shape
// collapses a scoped-global `match from-zone` / `match to-zone` to the
// all-zones wildcard. Both parser shapes produce it: hierarchically the leaf is
// Keys=["source-address"] with no children; via ParseSetCommand + SetPath the
// flat path lands on the same node. The gate protected a claim about VALUES
// with a check on NAMES; this predicate closes the gap by asking
// firewallMatchValues — the SAME reader compilePolicy uses — whether the
// dimension carries anything, so the reject gate and the compiler can never
// disagree about what "present" means.
//
// Union semantics (#3842 parity): a dimension is flagged only when the values
// accumulated across EVERY `match {}` block are empty — precisely the condition
// under which the compiled slice is empty and the dimension widens. A policy
// that writes `source-address;` in one block and `source-address 10.0.0.0/8;`
// in a duplicate block compiles to [10.0.0.0/8] and is NOT widened, so it is
