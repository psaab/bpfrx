// #8443: an unmatched keyword under an OSPF interface's `authentication { }`
// block committed clean and left the adjacency UNAUTHENTICATED.
//
// #8473 closed the IS-IS and RIP half of #8443, where `authentication-type` is
// a real free-form leaf and an unrecognised value downgraded md5 to plaintext.
// OSPF's half is a different grammar and was left open deliberately. OSPF has
// no `authentication-type` leaf at all — it uses a nested block whose CHILD
// KEYWORD selects the algorithm:
//
//	interface ge-0/0/0.0 { authentication { md5 <key-id> { key "s"; } } }
//	interface ge-0/0/0.0 { authentication { simple-password "s"; } }
//
// `compiler_protocols.go` assigns `OSPFInterface.AuthType` ONLY from a matched
// `md5` / `simple-password`, so there is no free-form value to type-check. A
// keyword that matches neither leaves `AuthType == ""`, and the renderer emits
// nothing — the adjacency forms unauthenticated while `show configuration`
// echoes the authentication block back to the operator verbatim. Measured
// before this change, every row committing clean:
//
//	authentication { md5 1 { key "SEKRIT"; } }      AuthType="md5"  correct
//	authentication { md5-typo 1 { key "SEKRIT"; } } AuthType=""     UNAUTHENTICATED
//	authentication { md5 1 { keyy "SEKRIT"; } }     AuthType="md5"  key dropped, renders nothing
//	authentication-type md5;                        AuthType=""     UNAUTHENTICATED
//
// The failure direction is what makes this a defect rather than an
// inconvenience: the operator believes the adjacency is protected, and every
// surface they can check agrees with them.
//
// Two mechanisms close it, because the four rows above are two different shapes:
//
//   - The first three are unmodeled keywords INSIDE a modeled subtree, so
//     `closedWorld: true` on the `authentication` node is exactly the right
//     instrument. It is opt-in per subtree and inherits down (schema_walk.go),
//     which is what also catches the misspelled `key` child of `md5`.
//   - The fourth is a leaf that does not exist under OSPF at all, so closing
//     `authentication`'s world cannot see it. It is modeled here SOLELY so it
//     is refused, in the shape #7971 established for the login-class
//     `*-regexps` family. Closing the whole OSPF `interface` world would also
//     catch it, and was measured to leave the pkg/config suite green — but it
//     converts EVERY unmodeled protocol leaf from inert to refused, which is
//     the #8296 class and a much larger decision than this issue's scope.
