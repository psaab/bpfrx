// #8690/#8752: `security policies … policy <p> scheduler-name`.
//
// SUPERSEDED BY #8752, AND RE-POINTED RATHER THAN DELETED. This cell used to
// pin the site as `wrong-remedy`: normalizing it would move the packed tail
// into a SPURIOUS DUPLICATE policy, restoring the schedule onto the wrong
// object. #8752 folds a repeated `policy <p>` into the first occurrence on the
// tolerant path, so there is no longer a wrong object to land on, and the
// premise of that classification is gone.
//
// What the fold changed, measured on the LENIENT path:
//
//	before   pol#1 sched=""  src=[any] PERMIT   +  pol#2 sched="S" src=[] DENY
//	after    pol#1 sched="S" src=[any] PERMIT       (one policy; the duplicate folded in)
//
// So the HARM this cell documented — a policy written TIME-LIMITED running
// PERMANENTLY ACTIVE — is fixed, and fixed WITHOUT the normalizer: the fold
// carries the packed tail onto the surviving policy itself.
//
// A NARROWER DIVERGENCE REMAINS, and it is the reason the site is now classed
// `open` rather than removed. At the census's own shape — a LONE
// `policy p1 scheduler-name S;` with no sibling to fold into — the schedule is
// still dropped where the block spelling carries it. Both halves are asserted
// below, because "the harm is fixed" and "there is nothing left here" are
// different claims and only the first one is true.
//
// The historical narrative is kept verbatim below. This entry has been wrong
// three times (`owed-own-change` → `no-drop-measured` → `wrong-remedy`), each
// time because a fixture chose a different spelling than the question was
// about, and the record of which spelling answers which question is the most
// reusable thing this file contains.
//
// ---- history, as written when the site was classed `wrong-remedy` ----
//
// The normalizer was the WRONG REMEDY for this site, and three measurements
// were needed to establish that because each earlier one used a different
// spelling.
//
// WHERE THE DUPLICATE SHAPE COMES FROM, stated precisely because an earlier
// version of this comment got it wrong. It is NOT what a CLI session produces:
// flat `set … policy p1 match …` followed by `set … policy p1 scheduler-name S`
// MERGES into one policy carrying both, measured in both orderings and on both
// compile paths. Attributing the duplicate to a pair of `set` lines was hand-
// written hierarchical text standing in for the flat-set spelling — the trap
// CLAUDE.md names ("ALWAYS use ParseSetCommand() + tree.SetPath(), NEVER
// NewParser()"), and the third instance of it on this one file in a day.
//
// It arrives as a config FILE with the two statements as siblings: hand-edited,
// written by an older build, or pushed by an un-upgraded primary. That is
// narrower than "an operator typed two set lines" — and it is exactly the
// population Store.Load and Store.SyncApply exist to accept, which is why the
// lenient path is still the right place to point at.
//
// THE HARM IS REAL. On the LENIENT path — which is what production uses on Load and
// SyncApply (configstore/store.go: boot config load and HA config sync) — that
// compiles to TWO policies named p1:
//
//	pol#1  sched=""   src=[any]  PERMIT    <- the operator's policy, schedule LOST
//	pol#2  sched=""   src=[]     DENY      <- a spurious match-less duplicate
//
// So a policy written as TIME-LIMITED runs PERMANENTLY ACTIVE. That much of the
// original forwarding concern was right.
//
// BUT NORMALIZING DOES NOT FIX IT. With ("policy","scheduler-name") ADMITTED —
// and that admission is load-bearing: at master, with the pair excluded, pol#2
// carries sched="" under BOTH skipNorm settings, because the pass touches 0
// nodes and the two runs are the same — the pass moves the packed tail into the
// DUPLICATE's body:
//
//	pol#1  sched=""   src=[any]  PERMIT    <- STILL scheduleless
//	pol#2  sched="S"  src=[]     DENY      <- the schedule lands here
//
// The schedule is restored onto the wrong policy. The defect is that the second
// `policy p1 …` statement DUPLICATES rather than merging — a policy-level
// defect (#3473 duplicate policy name; lane-8526's #8436 duplicate-block work),
// not a brace-elision one. Normalizing this pair changes only the inert
// census spelling, where the policy has no body and does nothing either way.
//
// THAT IS WHY IT MUST NOT BE SWEPT: admitting it removes two lines from the
// #2419 inventory and looks like progress, while the reachable harm is
// untouched. A remedy that clears the evidence without fixing the defect is
// worse than none.
//
// Why the earlier measurements disagreed, recorded so the next reader does not
// repeat them: the STRICT path REJECTS the elided spelling, so cfg is nil and
// there is nothing to inspect — a gate firing is the absence of a compiled
// result, not evidence about one. And any skipNorm comparison taken while the
// pair is EXCLUDED is vacuous, because the pass touches 0 nodes and both sides
// are the same run.
