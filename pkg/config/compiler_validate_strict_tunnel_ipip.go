// effectiveIpipTunnelSites returns every tunnel ENDPOINT the dataplane would
// actually emit whose mode is ipip, in the emitter's own order.
//
// It delegates to EmitTunnelEndpointNames rather than walking the compiled
// records itself. That is the point (#4785 re-gate B2): the emitter is already
// the single source of truth for "which tunnel endpoints reach the dataplane
// snapshot", it is what buildTunnelEndpointSnapshots consumes, and it is what
// the sibling commit-time gate validateTunnelEndpointIDCollisionAST is built
// on — so this gate now sits behind the same drift guarantee instead of
// hand-rolling a second model of a question the codebase already answers.
//
// Three defects came from that hand-rolled model and are closed by deleting it:
//
//   - A unit with NO tunnel stanza still inherits the interface-level tunnel —
//     which the emitter does, and says so in a comment. The old walk skipped
//     exactly those units (`unit.Tunnel == nil { continue }`), so
//     `ip-0/0/0 tunnel src/dst` + `unit 0 tunnel mode gre` + a bare `unit 2`
//     let unit 0's GRE record shadow the interface record on the shared device
//     key while unit 2 — which emits ipip — was never visited. That config
//     COMMITTED with the alarm surface silent, having been correctly REJECTED
//     one commit earlier. An over-rejection fix that becomes an
//     under-rejection is worse than the bug it replaced.
//   - The old model named routing.tunnelManager as the authority. Under the
//     userspace dataplane — the only supported runtime — collectAppliedTunnels
//     sets AnchorOnly and creates a mode-INDEPENDENT Tuntap anchor. What
//     decides gre_decap_index membership versus the TunnelKind::Unknown drop
//     arm is the EMITTED endpoint's mode, which is this function's input.
//   - The emitter applies the same source/destination screen the snapshot
//     builder does, so an endpoint reported here really is emitted. A `tunnel
//     destination` with no source emits nothing and is no longer reported as a
//     dead tunnel.
//
// Ordering is the emitter's — interfaces sorted by name, units by number — so
// the first reported strict error is stable across runs and identical on both
// HA nodes.

// emittedTunnelDeviceNames returns the set of Linux DEVICE names the emitted
// tunnel endpoints bind to at runtime.
//
// Runtime identity for a tunnel is the device name, not the *TunnelConfig
// pointer: routing keys its desired set by TunnelConfig.Name
// (pkg/routing/tunnel.go), so two records sharing a name are ONE kernel device,
// and the dataplane resolves an emitted endpoint ref to a device through
// snapshotLinuxName -> cfg.TunnelNameMap() (pkg/dataplane/userspace/interfaces.go),
// which for a unit with its own tunnel stanza is that UNIT's device even when
// the emitted endpoint carries the interface-level object.
//
// Resolution is STRUCTURAL — keyed on the (interface, unit) pair the emitter
// emitted from — not on parsing the emitted ref string (#6861 F1/F3). Two
// defects came from parsing the string, both reproduced before this fix:
//
//   - `LinuxIfName(ep.Name)` was NOT what snapshotLinuxName does for a bare
//     interface ref. Its no-unit arm resolves a `reth*` name through ResolveReth
//     first, so an emitted `reth0` endpoint was recorded live under "reth0"
//     when the snapshot actually binds it to the physical member "ge-0-0-0".
//     The harm is a FALSE POSITIVE on a different record: `ge-0/0/0` (reth0's
//     member) carrying its own unemitted ipip stanza has anchor device
//     "ge-0-0-0" — the very device reth0's endpoint runs on — so with the wrong
//     derivation that device is absent from the live set and the advisory calls
//     a live, traffic-carrying device dead. That is this gate's own defect class
//     surviving in its fallback arm.
//   - Looking the ref up in TunnelNameMap first let an interface whose AUTHORED
//     name contains a dot consume an unrelated unit's entry: `ip-0/0/0.0` is a
//     legal interface name, and both it and unit 0 of `ip-0/0/0` are emitted
//     under the identical ref "ip-0/0/0.0". Production collides on that too
//     (buildTunnelEndpointSnapshots keys ifaceByName by the same string), so
//     which device is live is genuinely undecidable here — and marking BOTH
//     live is the correct failure mode for an ADVISORY, whose harm is a false
//     "this device is dead" aimed at live config.
//
// The device derivation itself is still delegated: resolveBareKernelIfName and
// ResolveKernelIfName (pkg/config/types.go) are the sanctioned config-side twin
// of snapshotLinuxName, carrying a drift-guard test in the userspace package.
// What this function owns is only the structural walk — which (interface, unit)
// pair each emitted ref came from — mirroring how buildInterfaceSnapshots names
// its rows.

	// when that id is already taken, so the later-sorting collider is dropped.
	// Counting it as live suppressed the advisory for an anchor whose endpoint

	// runtime keeps `wg0` and drops `wg34524.0`, and before this loop
	// live["wg34524"] was true — so the `wg34524` device the IPIP anchor
	// creates had no endpoint and no alarm.
	//
	// The iteration order is the builder's: EmitTunnelEndpointNames is the SSOT
	// both walk (sorted interface names, sorted unit numbers), and the builder

	// kernel device would, at runtime, leave the loser installed, and this loop
	// drops the loser anyway. That conjunction (a missing kernel device AND an
	// id collision) is the one shape where the drop can produce a false "this

// anchor, and its two screens are NOT the emitter's:
//
//   - INTERFACE level: appended whenever `Source != ""` (or the mode is

//     which the emitter suppresses — still gets an anchor.
//   - UNIT level: appended for EVERY non-nil `unit.Tunnel`, with no
//     completeness screen at all. A unit carrying only a destination emits
//     nothing and still gets an anchor.
//
// Both shapes must be walked. The unit half is not optional and not new: the
// #4788 advisory this gate replaced walked units, and dropping it meant
//
//	set interfaces ip-0/0/0 unit 5 tunnel destination 10.0.0.2
//
// committed with NEITHER the strict rejection (nothing is emitted, so the gate
// is silent by design) NOR any standing alarm, while still creating a visible
// `ip-0-0-0u5` device that carries nothing. That directly contradicts the
// reason the advisory is registered at all.
//
// This is an ADVISORY, not a rejection, deliberately. The anchor carries no
// traffic but breaks nothing, the operator may well have meant the unit-level
// tunnel, and blocking the commit would re-import the over-rejection this gate
// has already swung through twice. An alarm names it; a commit does not stop
// for it.
//
// The predicate is ASYMMETRIC between the two sites, and both shapes are
// measured rather than assumed (#6861 r5):
//
//	interface: !emitted[t] && !live[t.Name]
//	unit:                    !live[unit.Tunnel.Name]
//
// The interface site's conjunction is deliberate — do not "simplify" it to one
// clause. Neither clause subsumes the other, and each was at one point the whole
// predicate and wrong on its own:
//
//   - `emitted[t]` is POINTER identity: "is this record the object the emitter
//     published". It is the advisory's stated contract — a record with no
//     emitted endpoint. Alone it is wrong, because several unemitted records
//     SHARE a device with an emitted one (below), and it declared those live
//     devices dead.
//   - `live[t.Name]` is DEVICE identity: "is this record's kernel device claimed
//     by something the emitter published". Alone it is also wrong: an emitted
//     record whose own device name differs from where its endpoint binds —
//     `reth0`, whose endpoint resolves to the physical member `ge-0-0-0` — gets
//     reported as a dead anchor. That record is already covered, correctly, by
//     the dead-endpoint advisory (ipipUnimplementedText), so this would be a
//     SECOND diagnosis of one record, with a structurally false cause ("every
//     unit overrides it" on an interface that has no units) pointing the
//     operator at the wrong stanza.
//
// The UNIT site carries only the device clause, because the pointer clause there
// is provably redundant rather than merely unmeasured: TunnelNameMap keys a
// unit's device BY unit.Tunnel.Name, and compiler_interfaces.go always assigns a
// non-empty Name at construction, so an emitted unit record's device is its own
// name and live[] necessarily holds it. Dropping it reds nothing; dropping the
// interface one reds TestIpipEmittedRecordIsNeverAlsoAnAnchor_6861.
//
// WHY POINTER KEYING AND NOT `emittedName[t.Name]` — a separate question from
// whether the clause exists at all, and one the reth case above does NOT answer.
// In that case the emitted record IS `t`, so a name-keyed set suppresses it just
// as well; TestIpipEmittedRecordIsNeverAlsoAnAnchor_6861 stays green under the
// re-keying and therefore proves only that SOME emitted-check is present.
//
// The keying is decided by the one shape where an emitted record is NOT `t` yet
// shares `t.Name`, with that name absent from live[]. The shapes that can put an
// interface-site candidate on a SHARED, NON-LIVE Name are two — and that
// qualified statement is the exhaustive one (#6861 re-gate C4). An earlier
// revision claimed Name sharing itself had only two sources, which is false: an
// interface authored `gr-0/0/0u1` shares a Name with `gr-0/0/0 unit 1`, a third
// and COMMITTABLE shape. It cannot be turned into a discriminator here (the unit
// ref puts that very name in live[], so the device clause decides first), so the
// conclusion is unchanged; the underlying authored-vs-derived name collision is
// filed separately as #6964. The two that do decide the keying:
//
// An interface-level record and its own unit 0 — where TunnelNameMap
// puts that very name in live[], so the device clause decides first and the
// keying never matters — or two DIFFERENT interface keys canonicalizing to
// one Linux name, since LinuxIfName only replaces '/' with '-' (`gr-0/0-0` and
// `gr-0/0/0` both give `gr-0-0-0`). Pair that with interface-level WireGuard
// whose lowest unit is > 0, where the emitter publishes the INTERFACE pointer at
// ref `X.u` (#1910) while TunnelNameMap resolves `X.u` to the UNIT device
// `X u<n>`, and the name is emitted while the device is not live. Name keying
// then drops a real dead ipip anchor on the strength of an unrelated
// interface's name. Bound by
// TestIpipAnchorEmittedClauseIsPointerKeyedNotNameKeyed_6861, which reds on
// exactly that re-keying.
//
// SCOPE of that difference, because it bounds the claim: the LITERAL fixture is
// rejected by a strict LOCAL commit — the duplicate Linux-device-name gate
// (compiler_validate_strict_ifname_collision.go) fires on the two interface
// keys.
//
// That bound is the LOCAL STRICT EFFECTIVE VIEW and no wider. An earlier
// revision said "on anything committable the two keyings are equivalent", which
// is categorical and false (#6861 re-gate, Codex 4): put the collision fixture
// only in node1's `${node}` group and keep node0 clean. compileTreeStrict
// strictly compiles node0 ONLY, the peer compile downgrades the duplicate-name
// gate, and the peer registry carries just the SNAT and emitted-IPIP subjects —
// and this candidate is source-only, so the emitter drops it before the IPIP
// subject ever sees it. Node0 commits; node1 then activates the exact shape
// through SyncApply.
//
// What pointer keying protects is therefore the TOLERANT surface (#1960):
// configstore Load/SyncApply lenient-compiles a config the local strict commit
// would refuse, and `show system alarms` — the actual rendering command, not
// plain `show system` — renders ValidateConfig's warnings for whatever is
// active. Kept because it is correct on its own terms rather than by borrowing
// another gate's guarantee.
//
// The orphan `reth0` device in that second case is real, but it is not this
// gate's subject: the same orphan appears with `mode gre`, where #4785 is
// deliberately silent, so #4785 is not its cause. It is the routing-vs-dataplane
// name divergence tracked in #6941 (routing keys its desired set by
// TunnelConfig.Name; the dataplane binds via snapshotLinuxName).
//
// Why the DEVICE clause has to exist at all: the advisory's claim is about a
// Linux device — "an interface an operator can see that carries no traffic" —
// and these records share one device with an emitted one:
//
//   - GRE/IPIP UNIT 0. compiler_interfaces.go gives unit 0's per-unit tunnel
//     the BASE Linux name, identical to the interface-level record's, and
//     routing keys its desired set by that name (pkg/routing/tunnel.go), so
//     the two records are one device. With `ip-0/0/0 tunnel source/destination`
//     plus `unit 0 tunnel mode gre`, the emitter publishes the unit's GRE
//     pointer (#5635) and the interface pointer is unemitted — but the device
//     it names is the one carrying the working GRE tunnel. The pointer test
//     declared that live device dead.
//   - A UNIT under an interface-level WireGuard stanza. The emitter publishes
//     ONE endpoint keyed by the lowest unit carrying the INTERFACE-level
//     pointer (#1910), while TunnelNameMap resolves that same unit ref to the
//     UNIT's own device — which is what snapshotLinuxName, and therefore the
//     tunnel-endpoint snapshot, binds the WireGuard TUN to. The unit's pointer
//     is unemitted; its device is live WireGuard infrastructure.
//
// The name comes from cfg.TunnelNameMap() — the same map
// pkg/dataplane/userspace/interfaces.go:snapshotLinuxName consults to fill
// InterfaceSnapshot.LinuxName — so there is ONE source of truth for the device
// name and the advisory cannot drift from what the dataplane opens.

//
// The earlier single-cause wording always said "every unit overrides it"
// (#4785 fold F3). For a stanza the emitter suppressed because its endpoint is
// incomplete that diagnosis is false, and the per-unit remediation it implies
// is the wrong advice, so the incomplete cause is checked FIRST: it is shared
// by both kinds of record and takes precedence for either, because an endpoint
// missing a half stays unemitted even once any other suppressor is gone.
//
// The two COMPLETE-but-unemitted fallbacks are genuinely different causes, and
// collapsing them into the interface wording was wrong three ways for a unit —
// it named a unit and then explained the interface-level stanza, inverted the
// direction (the interface-level stanza suppressed the unit, not the units
// overriding the interface), and pointed remediation at the wrong stanza
// (#6861 F1). Enumerated against the emitter, a COMPLETE record reaches here
// only via:
//
//   - INTERFACE, with units: EmitTunnelEndpointNames walks the units and emits
//     each unit's own TunnelConfig (#5635), so the interface-level object is
//     never published. "every unit overrides it" is exactly right.
//   - UNIT, under an interface-level `tunnel mode wireguard` stanza: that mode

// IPIP parses, compiles, and reaches the dataplane snapshot, but the userspace
// dataplane — the only supported runtime — has no IPIP primitive in either
// direction:
//
//   - INBOUND: forwarding_build/tunnels.rs indexes an endpoint into
//     `gre_decap_index` only when `tunnel_mode_kind(&endpoint.mode) ==
//     TunnelKind::Gre`. `ipip` classifies as `TunnelKind::Unknown`, so it is
//     never indexed and a received proto-4 frame has nothing to decap against.
//   - OUTBOUND: `TunnelKind::Unknown` is the fail-closed arm of the egress
//     encap dispatcher, which drops rather than defaulting to GRE encap (the
//     pre-#2327 fail-open behaviour).
//
// So the endpoint is dead in BOTH directions. Before this gate it committed
// green with only an advisory (#4788): the operator got a configured interface
// that passes no traffic and no error to act on. Converting the advisory into a
// rejection is the "reject, don't guess" resolution — an unimplemented feature
// must fail loudly at commit rather than succeed into a blackhole.
//

// when it lands this gate is removed, not relaxed.

// site tolerates it on the load / peer-sync paths (opts.lenientIpipTunnelMode)
