// compiler_nat_dnat_to.go carries the #3444 reject-at-commit gate for a
// destination-NAT rule-set `to` scope.
//
// A Junos destination-NAT rule-set has only a `from` clause (zone |
// interface | routing-instance). DNAT translates the destination address on
// the inbound packet, so there is no egress / `to` context yet — only source
// NAT (which has both `from` and `to`) and the routed forward path can scope
// by an egress context. xpf's setSchema briefly advertised a `to` scope under
// `security nat destination rule-set`, and compileNATDestination
// Cartesian-expanded the collected `to` scopes onto each NATRuleSet
// (ToZone/ToInterface/ToRoutingInstance). But the userspace snapshot builder
// (pkg/dataplane/userspace/nat.go buildDestinationNATSnapshots) and the Rust
// DNAT runtime (userspace-dp/src/nat/destination.rs) model ONLY the `from`
// clause for DNAT — the DestinationNATRuleSnapshot wire struct intentionally
// has no `to_*`. So a configured `to zone|interface|routing-instance` was
// silently dropped: the translation applied regardless of the operator's
// declared destination context, and the operator got no error. Admitting a
// `to` scope that the running firewall does not enforce is a silent
// functional lie, so this gate hard-rejects it at commit / commit-check and
// warns (does not fail) on the tolerant load / peer-sync paths per the #1960
// fail-closed-on-load doctrine.
//
// This is an AST pre-walk (not a SchemaValidate typed leaf) because
// SchemaValidate is opt-in per known leaf and returns nil for unknown
// keywords by design (schema_walk.go) — it cannot REJECT a stanza, and the
// `to` keyword itself is legitimate elsewhere (source NAT rule-sets). The
// `to` subtree has also been removed from the DNAT rule-set setSchema so the
// CLI no longer offers it in completion; this gate covers the runtime
// reject + the already-persisted lenient-load path. Detection is scoped to
// `security nat destination rule-set` so the source-NAT `to` clause (a real
// feature) is never touched. The walk runs on the group-expanded,
// inactive-pruned tree (compileConfigWithOpts / compileConfigForNodeWithOpts
// strip inactive subtrees and expand groups before compileExpanded), so an
// apply-groups-inherited `to` is caught and an `inactive:` rule-set is
// ignored for free.

// validateDNATRuleSetToScopeAST walks the `security nat destination
// rule-set` subtree of the group-expanded AST and rejects any rule-set
// carrying a `to` scope.
//
// Strict path (commit / commit-check, lenient=false): the first offending
// rule-set is a hard compile error, naming the exact rule-set.
//
// Lenient path (load / peer-sync, lenient=true): every offending rule-set is
// returned as a warning and compilation continues. The `to` subtree is NOT
// pruned — compileNATDestination no longer reads it (collectNATScopes with
// wantTo=false), so leaving it in the cloned tree is harmless and the warning
// is the operator signal.

	// Iterate ALL matching children at EVERY level the walk descends, not
	// the first match at any level. parseStatements APPENDS a repeated block
	// instead of merging it (parser.go), and the compiler iterates siblings
	// at each level it descends — compileExpanded processes every `security`
	// root, compileSecurity compiles every `nat` sibling. So a first-match-
	// only walk is bypassable at EVERY level (the multi-level duplicate-block
	// class, #3562): e.g. ONE `security` root with a benign first `nat {}` +
	// a second `nat { destination { rule-set RD { to zone trust; ... } } }`
	// would slip past a first-`nat` walk while the compiler still compiles
	// the second `nat`'s rule-set with the `to` silently dropped (the
	// original #3444 bug, reachable via a hierarchical LoadOverride input).
	// Using forEachChild at security/nat/destination guarantees a DNAT `to`
	// in ANY duplicate block at ANY level is caught. The inner rule-set
	// iteration + narrow direct-`to` check is unchanged — the scope
	// precision stays destination-only so the source-NAT `to` (#3096) is
	// untouched. (compileNAT itself reads only the first `destination` per
	// `nat`, so a duplicate `destination` WITHIN one `nat` is not currently
	// compiler-reachable for the silent drop; the walk rejects it anyway —
	// fail-closed and defensive against future compiler changes.)
