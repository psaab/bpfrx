// #9192 — one authored BGP neighbor could occupy several AST nodes, and
// compileBGP appended one *BGPNeighbor per NODE.
//
// A bare declaration and a later sub-leaf are separate nodes, because SetPath
// does not reuse a node it has already marked IsLeaf:
//
//	set protocols bgp group G neighbor 10.0.2.2
//	set protocols bgp group G neighbor 10.0.2.2 import PS
//	  -> [neighbor 10.0.2.2]
//	     [neighbor 10.0.2.2] > [import PS]
//
// That is ordinary flat-set authoring, and it produced TWO entries for one
// peer. The rendered FRR output was redundant rather than wrong, which is why
// nothing caught it — but the duplication is invisible in the typed config's
// contract, so anything reasoning over `BGP.Neighbors` AS A SET OF PEERS is
// wrong by construction. Two consumers were already caught by it on #9007: a
// duplicate-address check that reported "configured in more than one group
// (G and G)" and false-rejected a legitimate config, and a first-wins dedup at
// the renderer that silently dropped the policy-bearing entry along with its
// `activate` and `route-map … in` lines.
