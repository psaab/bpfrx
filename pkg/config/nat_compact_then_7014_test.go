// onto the `then` node itself, so the compilers — which look for a
// `source-nat` / `destination-nat` CHILD — found nothing and produced ZERO
// actions. The zero-action arm then rejected the rule with a message saying it
// "carries no translation action", for a stanza that visibly carries one.
//
// It failed CLOSED, so no traffic was mishandled; the cost was a legal Junos
// spelling that would not commit, refused with a diagnostic contradicting the
// config in front of the operator.
//
// Flat-set is unaffected and is asserted as such below: SetPath builds the
// child, so `set … then source-nat off` produces the hierarchical shape.
