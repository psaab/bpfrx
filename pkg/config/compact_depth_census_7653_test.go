// compact_depth_census_7653_test.go — #7653.
//
// The #2419 census measures ONE packing depth. For a site with container path
// `[... authentication]` and leaf `simple-password` it compares
//
//	authentication { simple-password "x"; }     the block spelling
//	authentication simple-password "x";         the compact spelling
//
// which packs exactly ONE container onto the leaf line. Junos compaction is
// recursive, and operators write it that way:
//
//	authentication simple-password "x"    <- 2 tokens of packing  (measured)
//	authentication md5 7 key "x"          <- 3 tokens             (NOT measured)
//
// Every depth beyond the first is unmeasured, and a compiler that reads
// `prop.Children` correctly at one level can still drop the body at two. So the
// existing 354-divergent figure is a floor in a second, previously unstated
// dimension: not only "204 unruled sites", but "one packing depth of an
// arbitrarily deep spelling".
//
// This file extends the SAME walker rather than re-deriving it — same
// collectCompactSites, synthPair, contextFor, nest, compileText, cfgEqual — so
// the two censuses cannot drift into disagreeing about what a site is.
