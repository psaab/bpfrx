// A value-bearing `from` leaf written with no operand compiles to the
// byte-identical empty match set the OMITTED form produces, and the matcher
// reads empty as match-ANY. So `from protocol;` beside `then discard` discards
// every protocol, and beside `then accept` opens every protocol — the term
// widens in whichever direction the action points.
//
// Security policies have rejected this since #6526 and NAT since #8430; this is
// #8430's unshipped remainder, so the value of the cells is as much about the
// CONSISTENCY as about the defect.
