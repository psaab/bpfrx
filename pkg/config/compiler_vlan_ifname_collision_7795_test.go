// the TUNNEL derivation, which is the one that produced the name.
//
// (The sub-interface-vs-tunnel cross-product itself is unreachable: a
// sub-interface device is `<base>.<digits>` and a tunnel device is
// `<base>u<digits>`, so the character before the trailing digit run is "." in
// one and "u" in the other and they can never be equal. That argument is

// instead.)

// NO FAIL-ON-REVERT, stated rather than implied. Deleting the

// before pass 3 runs, and a tunnel device that collides with nothing produces
// no report from either pass. So the skip has no observable effect today and
// this cell cannot bind it.
//
// The skip stays because it makes the ownership explicit — pass 3 must not
// compute a name pass 2 owns — and because the ordering that makes it
// unobservable is pass 2's `return`, not a property of the derivations. If a
// future change collects collisions instead of returning on the first, the
// duplicate report appears immediately and the skip is what prevents it.
//
// What this cell DOES bind is that the operator gets the TUNNEL derivation in
// the message, so pass 3 has not preempted pass 2's clearer explanation.
