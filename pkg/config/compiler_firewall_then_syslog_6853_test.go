// #6853: `then log` and `then syslog` name DIFFERENT sinks in Junos — the
// firewall filter log buffer (`show firewall log`) and the system log
// respectively — but both spellings compiled to `term.Log` alone, so the two
// were indistinguishable in the model and could never be routed apart.
//
// What this change does and does NOT do, because the difference is the whole
// point of shipping it separately from #6859:
//
//   - It makes the distinction REPRESENTABLE. `then syslog` now sets Syslog in
//     addition to Log.
//   - It changes NO behaviour. `then syslog` already reached the system log,
//     because filter-log events are categorised CategoryFirewall
//     (pkg/logging/ringbuf.go) and the syslog fan-out is gated only by a
//     per-CLIENT category filter, never per-term. Both spellings emitted, and
//     both still do.
//
// Keeping Log set on the syslog arm is therefore load-bearing rather than
// conservative: Log is what makes the dataplane emit a filter-log event at
// all, so clearing it would stop `then syslog` producing anything — a
// regression dressed as a fix.
//
// #6859 owns the other direction (whether `then log` should STOP reaching
// syslog), which is a real behaviour change with a migration cost.
