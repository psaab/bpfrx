// #8104: the AST config-read route had no census, and that is how a
// credential-bearing feed path rendered verbatim on `show configuration` for
// years while the REST route redacted the same value.
//
// THREE INSTANCES, all the same shape — the typed route redacts, the AST route
// does not, and nothing compares them:
//
//   - `feed-server <s> feed-name <f> path`  — #7406, fixed 250031dfc
//   - `feed-server <s> hostname`            — found by THIS census, fixed here
//   - `wireguard peer <p> endpoint`         — found by THIS census, fixed here
//
// The second one was predicted in writing by the change that created the
// divergence. FeedServer.Hostname's redaction comment (#6733) says it is
// "named for what it IS, not for what it may carry, so the name-keyed
// redaction pass never masked it — and an operator who writes
// `user:token@feeds.example` here leaks it through the authenticated REST
// GET." That fix covered the REST surface and nothing carried it to the AST
// one.
//
// WHY THE TWO SURFACES DIVERGED AND STAYED DIVERGED. The JSON census
// (url_field_redaction_census_6733_test.go) enumerates its population by
// REFLECTION over typed *Config fields, so it maintains itself. The AST
// redactor has no type to reflect over — `urlLeafIndices` matches keywords in
// a []string path — so its population can only be enumerated deliberately,
// which is exactly why nobody did.
//
// THE PREDICATE. A leaf is URL-shaped iff THE TYPED ROUTE RUNS ITS FIELD
// THROUGH A URL-REDACTION HELPER. That is checkable, stable, and it asserts
// the AGREEMENT between the two surfaces rather than pinning either to a
// heuristic — a heuristic encodes which side you trust, and the defect here is
// precisely that the two sides disagreed. It also maintains itself: adding a
// RedactURL call on the typed side enrols the leaf here automatically.
//
// A name heuristic was measured and rejected. Copying the JSON census's
// patterns selects 18 of the schema's 2,171 leaves and includes NetFlow
// `version9-template` — template NAMES, not URLs — reproducing the exact
// false-population failure that census's own comment records from its first
// draft. The agreement predicate selects 12, with no judgement in it.

// urlRedactionHelpers are the calls that constitute "the typed route redacts
// this as a URL".
//
// FOLLOW THE HELPERS, NOT ONE FUNCTION NAME. redactURLSlice is here because the
// first version of this scan defined the population as "calls RedactURL" and
// SILENTLY MISSED the archive-sites class, which reaches RedactURL through that
// wrapper. It would have shipped as a census that appears to enumerate a
// population while omitting a class — and the omission would have been
// invisible, because this file is what you would consult to find it.
//
// The general form, for whoever extends this and reaches for the same grep:
// defining a set as "things that call X" is a CLAIM that X is the only route to
// the behaviour. That is a population claim and it owes the same scrutiny as
// any other. Whenever a set is defined that way, check what reaches X through a
// wrapper before trusting the count.
