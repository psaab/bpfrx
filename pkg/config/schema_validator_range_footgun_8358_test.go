// #8358: a reversed range silently disabled the check.
//
// `ValidateInteger`'s body guards its comparison with `min <= max`, so
// `ValidateInteger(1, 0)` — the shape a caller reaches for when they mean "at
// least 1" and mis-order the arguments — returned a validator that accepted
// EVERY integer, and nothing said so.
//
// That is the worst shape a check can have. It fails to a value
// indistinguishable from a healthy one: the leaf has a validator, review sees a
// validator, `?` completion shows a typed leaf, and the gate does nothing. It
// would be found the way this class is always found — by an operator committing
// something absurd that works.
//
// Found while establishing that #8358's premise was wrong: the two-sided
// constructor it asks for already exists (109 sites, three times as many as
// `ValidateIntegerMin`). This footgun is the one real residue of that issue.
