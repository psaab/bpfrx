// #6850: the five accepted-but-inert CoS advisories are an operator's ONLY
// signal that a knob does nothing. Every existing guard for them asserts one
// direction — that the advisory FIRES when the knob is set. None asserts that
// it stays SILENT when the knob is absent.
//
// A positive-only axis is not "mostly covered". It is covered in one direction
// and blind in the others, and the blind direction is invisible precisely
// because the tests pass: drop the `> 0` / `len(...) > 0` presence gate on any
// of these five and every pre-existing guard stays green while the advisory
// fires on configurations that never set the knob. An advisory that warns about
// a knob the operator did not configure is how the one signal they get becomes
// noise they learn to scroll past — the same harm the knob being inert causes,
// arriving by the opposite route.
//
// So each knob gets a PAIR. The negative row alone would pass if the advisory
// were deleted outright; the positive row alone is what already exists. Only
// together do they pin "fires exactly when the knob is set".
//
// Every negative fixture deliberately BUILDS THE ENCLOSING ENTITY — a
// traffic-control-profile, a scheduler, a rewrite-rules stanza — and omits only
// the knob. A fixture that omitted the whole stanza would leave the advisory's
// enclosing block unexecuted, so deleting the presence gate would change
// nothing and the cell would be a false green.
