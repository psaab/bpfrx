// Bracketed interface address lists — #9424.
//
// `family inet { address [ 10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24 ]; }` compiled to ONE
// address. The second and every further address was discarded with no error and
// no warning, through all four config channels and in both AST shapes, on both
// families. The two-separate-stanzas spelling of the same configuration works,
// which is what makes the loss invisible: nothing about the compiled unit says
// an address is missing.
//
// This is the #2419 class. The lexer strips `[`/`]`, so a bracketed list
// collapses onto ONE leaf's Keys in the hierarchical shape and into a CHAIN in
// the flat-set shape:
//
//	hier  [family inet] > [address 10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24]
//	flat  [family inet] > [address 10.0.0.1/24] > [10.0.0.2/24]
//
// and `namedInstances` (compiler_protocols.go) reads slot 0 only — `Keys[1]`
// and nothing else — so both shapes lose everything past the first. #6662 and
// #7653 both swept `namedInstances` callers and did not reach this one.
//
// # Accumulate, not refuse, and the discriminator that makes that safe
//
// The sibling members of this class were resolved by REFUSING — `security-zone
// [ a b ]` (#8794), a bracketed to-zone list (#9246), `device-map interface
// [ a b ]` (#8810). Each of those refused because EXPANDING would have invented
// a semantics the platform does not have: one policy name living in several
// zone-pair contexts, one device mapped twice. That argument does not apply
// here. A logical unit with two addresses is an ordinary, fully supported
// configuration — the two-stanza control compiles exactly it — so the bracketed
// spelling is a spelling of something real, not a request for something
// undefined.
//
// The reason accumulation needs care is that the packed shape is AMBIGUOUS with
// the brace-elided sub-statement spelling. These parse identically:
//
//	address 10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24;   a bracketed list  -> two ADDRESSES
//	address 10.0.0.1/24 primary;       an elided body    -> one address + a flag
//
// so a detector keyed on "the node carries extra Keys" refuses the legal
// spelling too. That is the false-positive shape #9246 hit twice and found by
// running the suite rather than by reasoning.
//
// The discriminator is taken from the SCHEMA rather than from a hand-written
// list, so it cannot drift from what the grammar declares: a trailing token is
// an ADDRESS if the address node's own `keyValidator` accepts it
// (ValidateIPv4CIDR / ValidateIPv6CIDR — the exact function the typed-leaf gate
// runs on the first address), a SUB-STATEMENT if it names a declared child of
// `address`, and MALFORMED otherwise.
//
// The malformed arm is not decoration. Without it the fix would turn one silent
// drop into another: `address [ 10.0.0.1/24 not-an-address ]` is accepted today
// with the garbage discarded, and the typed-leaf gate validates only the FIRST
// key slot, so accumulating the valid extras while ignoring the invalid ones
// would leave exactly this issue's defect in place for the case that matters
// most. Malformed tokens are recorded on InterfacesConfig.MalformedAddresses
// and refused by validateInterfaceAddressListStrict — the same
// record-at-compile / reject-in-a-strict-gate shape as
// ScreenProfile.UnknownLeaves and SecurityConfig.MalformedZonePairs, with the
// #1960 lenient downgrade.
//
// OUT OF SCOPE, deliberately: the elided `address 10.0.0.1/24 primary;` spelling
// still loses `primary` in the HIERARCHICAL shape while the flat spelling
// applies it. That is the brace-elision class #9056 owns (its remedy is an
// admission into compactNormalizeInScope), it is a different mechanism, and it
// is measured unchanged by this change rather than assumed unchanged — a cell
// pins the current behaviour so the divergence is visible instead of forgotten.

// addressListInstance is one address configured under a family node, with the
// node its sub-statements (primary / preferred / vrrp-group) hang off.
//
// For an extra address that arrived packed onto a leaf's Keys there is no node
// of its own — the operator could not have attached a sub-statement to it in
// that spelling — so a childless placeholder is used and every FindChild below
// correctly finds nothing. That is deliberate rather than incidental: reusing
// the NAMED instance's node here would apply its `primary` to every address in
// the bracket.
