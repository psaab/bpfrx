// #8317: a redundancy-group id has TWO ceilings and only one was enforced.
//
//	heartbeat per-group id field is one byte -> 255  (enforced, with a message)
//	rg_active / ha_watchdog array length     -> 16   (NOT enforced)
//
// Both limits were already written down. The 16 existed only as the max_entries
// of the two BPF arrays the id indexes, so nothing connected it to the value an
// operator types, and ids 16..255 committed against arrays whose valid indices
// are 0..15.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS AT RUNTIME, measured rather than inferred: a BPF array with
// max_entries 16 accepts an update at key 15 and returns E2BIG ("key too big
// for map") at 16, 17 and 255. `Manager.UpdateRGActive` returns that error
// BEFORE recording the group or syncing HA state to the helper, so the RG never
// activates and its RETH interfaces never forward, while the reconcile loop
// retries forever (#757). A loud, permanent failure rather than a silent one —
// but a failure the operator was allowed to commit.
