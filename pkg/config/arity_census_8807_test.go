// #8807 predicate A (arity): the compiler reads a constant Keys[i] inside a

//
// WHAT THIS PREDICATE CANNOT SEE, stated here and repeated in every failure
// message, because a landed census guard READS AS COVERAGE:
//
//   It is NAME-KEYED. It pairs a compiler `case` label with schema declarations
//   that share that NAME, at any path. It cannot tell you the compiler site and
//   the declaration are the same path, and it therefore cannot see a leaf that
//   is undeclared at its own position while declared somewhere else. That is
//   the #8800 shape: `address` was unread-at-path under `nat source pool` while
//   declared under `proxy-arp interface` and elsewhere, so no name-keyed
//   predicate could surface it.
//
//   It also mis-ATTRIBUTES in the other direction. `preempt` was reported
//   because the chassis declaration (`children: nil`) was paired with the
//   INTERFACES compiler site, which handles `preempt hold-time <n>` packed.
//   Two self-consistent paths sharing a name; no defect. Of 12 hits at the time
//   of writing, SEVEN were pairings of this kind.
//
// So a green here means "no NEW name-keyed arity contradiction", never "the
// class is covered". The positional predicate is the thing that would cover it
// and it is not built (#8807, and #8787's closing note before that).
