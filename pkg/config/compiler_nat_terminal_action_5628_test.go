// #5628 (codex-review-181 M16): a source- or destination-NAT rule's complete
// `then {}` block must carry EXACTLY ONE NAT-terminal translation action —
// SNAT: `source-nat interface` | `source-nat pool <p>` | `source-nat off`;
// DNAT: `destination-nat pool <p>` | `destination-nat off`. Before the fix the
// schema permitted a block with ZERO actions (actionless: the snapshot builder
// installs no translation and the rule does not stop evaluation, so an intended
// `off` exemption silently disappears and the traffic falls through —
// translated by a later broader rule if one matches, otherwise left
// untranslated) or TWO+ mutually-exclusive actions (the
// compiler silently picked one by packed-key / child order, so an exemption
// could publish as a translation — the inverse of the authored action).
//
// validateNATTerminalActionCardinalityStrict hard-rejects both at strict commit
// (CompileConfig); the tolerant load / peer-sync path (CompileConfigLenient)
// downgrades to a warning (#1960 no-brick). Duplicate `then` CONTAINERS remain
// #3850's intentional last-wins merge and must NOT be rejected.
//
// RED on revert: reverting the gate (validateNATTerminalActionCardinalityStrict
// + its runUniformGates call) makes CompileConfig ACCEPT the zero/two-action
// configs, so every "want reject" case fails; reverting the compiler_nat_source
// / compiler_nat_destination hierarchical setter change (independent `if`s back
// to the `else if` chain) makes a single-node `source-nat { interface; pool p }`
// resolve to one field again, so the hierarchical two-action cases fail.

	//
	// This used to assert ten substrings with strings.Contains. That binds the
	// presence of bytes, and two mutations were measured green against it:
	//
	//   M-A  append "THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS FALSE: configuration order
	//        chooses the survivor." right after the survivor claim
	//   M-B  delete the clause "and never looking the pool up, and the
	//        dataplane applies the same " from the DNAT mechanism sentence
	//
	// Every asserted substring survives both. M-A is the one that matters: the
	// message asserts a claim and then explicitly denies it, and a guard whose
	// entire subject is whether this sentence is TRUE could not see it. An
	// addition is invisible to a containment check by construction, and a
	// deletion is invisible whenever the deleted text is not itself asserted —
	// which is most of the message.
	//
	// So the assertion is EQUALITY. The message is an operator-facing contract
	// that four rounds have already got wrong (#6820 r3 shipped a survivor
	// clause that was literally false for a 2-action rule; #7035 found the
	// unscoped form false in exactly the case that prints it; #7034 found the
	// parenthetical claiming a completeness it does not have), so pinning it
	// exactly is the point rather than a cost.
	//
	// Updating this golden is a DELIBERATE act. Classify the diff before you
	// regenerate: a reworded clause and a clause whose CLAIM changed look
	// identical in a diff that is merely accepted.
	//
	// What each clause is for, preserved from the rounds that put it there:
	//   - "every one of them is published to the dataplane" — the mechanism the
	//     compiler ACTUALLY uses (publish-all + dataplane precedence), not the
	//     pre-#5628 packed-key/child-order pick.
	//   - "WITHIN THIS BLOCK, the survivor is decided by that fixed precedence
	//     rather than by the order the actions were written" — the PRECISE form
	//     (#6820 r4). The loose paraphrase "not the one you configured first or
	//     last" is FALSE for a 2-action rule, where one action IS first and the
	//     other IS last. #7035 then scoped it: with duplicate `then` CONTAINERS
	//     the #3850 reset makes the LAST container supply the counted fields, so
	//     container order selects which contradiction you get.
	//   - "a contradiction whose tokens are PACKED onto one node" + "#7033" —
	//     #7034. The parenthetical used to end "this rejects contradictory
	//     actions inside one block", a completeness claim that is false for every
	//     token-packed spelling. #7033 then CLOSED that gap with a separate check
	//     that runs after this count, so the sentence no longer says the packed
	//     spelling is uncaught — it says which check catches it. The clause is
	//     still load-bearing: it is the only place the message admits that this
	//     count reads RESOLVED fields, which is why a packed contradiction is not
	//     its business.
