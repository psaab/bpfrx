// compiler_interface_unit_alias.go carries the #5631 (codex-review-181 M23)
// reject-at-commit gate for numeric interface-unit ALIASES — two distinct
// unit-number spellings under one interface that canonicalize to the SAME
// logical unit — PROMOTED in #5878 to a BOTH-NODE-EFFECTIVE union gate that
// runs PRE-expansion so a peer-only alias is caught at either node's commit.
//
// The compiler keys logical units by the numeric value: compileInterfaces
// (compiler_interfaces.go) iterates `namedInstances(child.FindChildren("unit"))`
// and canonicalizes each RAW spelling through `strconv.Atoi` — but only AFTER
// the AST has already split `unit 00` and `unit 0` into two SEPARATE named
// instances. The two instances then collide on the same `ifc.Units[unitNum]`
// key, and the two side effects disagree:
//
//   - `ifc.Units[unitNum] = unit` is LAST-WRITER-WINS: the later spelling's
//     unit (its filter, its addresses, its flags) completely REPLACES the
//     earlier one — so the interface's input/output firewall filter is decided
//     by config order.
//   - the interface-level tunnel address collection
//     (`ifc.Tunnel.Addresses = append(ifc.Tunnel.Addresses, unit.Addresses...)`)
//     is APPEND-ONLY: it accumulates the addresses of EVERY spelling, so a
//     stale address from the spelling that LOST the filter race still survives
//     on the tunnel.
//
// The observable result is order-dependent AND self-inconsistent: compiling
// `unit 00` then `unit 0` versus the reverse order yields a different final
// filter, a different unit address set, and a different tunnel-address set
// (see interface_unit_alias_5631_test.go). Because the winning filter flips
// with config order, an operator who reorders two otherwise-equivalent set
// lines can silently disarm the interface's firewall filter — a fail-open on
// a security hook — while the tunnel keeps forwarding on the stale address.
//
// Junos treats a logical unit as an integer identity: `unit 00` and `unit 0`
// are the SAME unit, and there is no meaningful configuration in which two
// numeric aliases of one unit carry DIFFERENT security state. Rather than pick
// an arbitrary winner (which spelling's filter survives is exactly the
// order-dependent ambiguity that makes this unsafe), this gate REJECTS the
// aliased config at commit so the operator authors a single canonical
// `unit <n>`. This matches how the rest of the compiler resolves unit
// identity (numeric) and the reject-at-commit / warn-on-load doctrine used by
// the sibling silent-inconsistency gates (validateApplicationNameCollisionsAST,
// validateFirewallFilterFamilyCollisionsAST, #1960 / #3261).
//
// # Both-node union (#5878)
//
// The #5631 gate originally ran INSIDE compileExpanded (runPreWalkGates) AFTER
// `tree.ExpandGroupsWithVars({node: nodeN})`, so it saw exactly the SUBMITTING
// node's post-`${node}` effective view. A `groups node1 { … unit 01 }` block
// applied through `apply-groups "${node}"` folds its aliasing spelling onto a
// base `unit 1` ONLY in the standby node's effective view — invisible at a
// node0 commit (Store.compileTree compiles s.nodeID only). The active node
// commits green; the standby's compiled config then diverges (a different
// firewall filter / address set) and a failover silently changes forwarding
// or security posture despite a "synchronized" commit (#5878).
//
// This gate is now the BOTH-NODE UNION, modeled EXACTLY on
// validateTunnelEndpointIDCollisionAST (tunnelid.go), and runs in the
// PRE-expansion gate block of compileConfigForNodeWithOpts /
// compileConfigWithOpts (beside the tunnel/zone/table-id gates):
//
//	View 1 — the PRE-expansion presence union across every top-level
//	  "interfaces" root AND every "groups" block, grouping raw unit spellings
//	  under each interface by canonical unit. Catches a collision hidden inside
//	  an un-expandable / node-inverted group and keeps the verdict identical on
//	  both nodes (a `groups node0`-scoped alias must reject on node1 too, or
//	  config-sync would split — originator accepts, peer rejects).
//	View 2 — the concrete per-interface unit spellings after expanding the
//	  candidate for node0 (ExpandGroupsWithVars + expandInterfaceRanges).
//	View 3 — the same for node1.
//
// Views 2/3 close the wildcard / interface-range gap: an apply-group that
// carries the aliasing spelling onto interfaces named by a wildcard or range
// registers only the literal wildcard name in View 1 (which never matches the
// base interface), so only post-expansion do both concrete spellings land on
// the same interface. Per-node expansion errors are NON-FATAL and contribute
// the EMPTY set (mirrors emitNodeExpandedTunnelNames): a config with only
// `groups node0` legitimately fails node1 expansion, and View 1 still covers
// any collision inside the un-expandable group. Because all three views are
// pure functions of the SAME candidate config (Views 2/3 both computed on both
// nodes), the union — and therefore the accept/reject verdict — is IDENTICAL on
// node0 and node1, and it is MONOTONE over the old single-view gate (it only
// ADDS rejects). Same HA-symmetry / monotonicity safety argument tunnelid.go
// makes.
//
// Strict path (commit / commit-check, lenient=false): the lowest colliding
// canonical unit on the lowest-named interface is a hard compile error naming
// the interface, the colliding spellings, and the canonical unit number.
//
// Lenient path (load / peer-sync, lenient=true): every collision is returned as
// a warning and compilation continues, so an already-persisted or peer-synced
// config an older binary silently accepted still BOOTS (#1960 no-brick
// doctrine). The operator gets the warning as the signal to collapse the
// aliases.
//
// This is an AST pre-walk (not a SchemaValidate typed leaf) for the same
// reason as validateUnsupportedInterfaceStanzasAST: the colliding instances
// are merged away by last-writer-wins by the time the typed `ifc.Units` map
// exists — only the raw AST still carries every spelling. Inactive subtrees are
// pruned before the pre-expansion gate block runs (cloneForExpansion), so an
// `inactive:` unit is ignored for free.
//
// Detection is scoped to DISTINCT spellings that canonicalize to the same
// number: a single canonical `unit 0` (the overwhelming common case) never
// trips it, and flat-set `set` lines with the SAME spelling merge into one AST
// node upstream (they are the same unit, not an alias). A non-numeric or
// out-of-range unit token is skipped — the compiler `continue`s on the
// identical CanonicalLogicalUnit error, so it never reaches `ifc.Units` and
// cannot collide.

// collectInterfaceUnitSpellingsAST folds the distinct raw unit spellings under
// each interface of one "interfaces" hierarchy node into perIface, keyed by
// interface name then by CANONICAL logical unit (#5878). Two spellings that
// CanonicalLogicalUnit maps to the same int land in the same inner set — that
// is the collision the gate rejects. A malformed / out-of-range unit token is
// dropped (the compiler drops it too), mirroring the pre-#5878 strconv.Atoi
// skip so detection matches what compileInterfaces actually consumes.
