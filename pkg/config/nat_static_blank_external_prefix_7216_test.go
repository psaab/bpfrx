// #7216: a static-NAT rule whose SELECTED `match destination-address` is empty
// committed clean, and the dataplane dropped the WHOLE mapping.
//
// MEASURED AT 7230dcdcd, over nat7145Base — the same base config #7145 swept —
// with the explicitly quoted empty value `""`:
//
//	kind         leaf                  master     here
//	source       source-address        rejected   rejected   (#7145, untouched)
//	source       destination-address   rejected   rejected   (#7145, untouched)
//	destination  source-address        rejected   rejected   (#7145, untouched)
//	destination  destination-address   rejected   rejected   (#3228, untouched)
//	static       source-address        rejected   rejected   (#7145, untouched)
//	static       destination-address   ACCEPTED   rejected   <- #7216
//
// WHAT THE EMPTY VALUE MEANS HERE, established before rejecting it. #6673 gave
// an empty slot in MatchAddresses a deliberate meaning and this change does not
// touch it. That meaning is a COUNTING rule: multiLeafAuthoredValues keeps empty
// slots so the list always contains what nodeVal selected, and the cardinality
// gate must therefore count only NON-EMPTY values — `destination-address
// 192.0.2.1/32` followed by `destination-address [ ]` authors ONE prefix and
// blanks it, and counting the blank as a second prefix would invent a rejection
// that gate was never meant to make.
//
// That is a rule about the LIST. It says nothing about whether a blank
// SELECTION is a shippable rule, and #6673 itself already answers that the
// other way: its `rule.Match == ""` arm rejects the blank selection outright,
// wording it "the selected value is EMPTY, so NONE of them takes effect and the
// dataplane drops the rule". #6673 could only see that case when two or more
// prefixes were also listed, because the arm sits inside `len(addrs) > 1`.
// TestStaticNATBlankExternalPrefix7216PreservesTheCardinalityContract below is
// what holds #6673's half in place while this one closes the rest.
//
// WHY THE BLANK IS NOT INERT. compileNATStatic selects rule.Match from the
// authored value, buildStaticNATSnapshots lowers it as
// StaticNATRuleSnapshot.ExternalIP, and the Rust parse_nat_prefix returns None
// on an empty string, so from_snapshots `continue`s and drops the ENTIRE
// mapping, recorded only as a bounded NAT parse-error counter (#4718).
//
// Per CLAUDE.md every flat-set case is built with ParseSetCommand + SetPath,
// never NewParser (which merges all set lines into one node).

// nat7216StaticCmds builds a static-NAT corpus over nat7145Base: the rule-set
// scaffolding, a `then static-nat prefix` target, and whatever match statements
// the case authors.
