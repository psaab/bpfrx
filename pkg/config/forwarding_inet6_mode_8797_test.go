// #8797: `forwarding-options family inet6 mode` compiled to nothing in every
// spelling an operator can produce.
//
// It read as "declared but unread" -- the leaf completes, validates, commits
// clean and renders back, and the compiled value stayed empty. It is not
// unread. `compileForwardingOptions` descended FindChild("family") ->
// FindChild("inet6"), a two-level lookup, while `family` is declared
// compoundKey and BOTH the parser and SetPath produce ONE node with
// Keys=["family","inet6"]. The only shape the old lookup matched is
// `family { inet6 { … } }` -- the shape the #2419 census synthesizes and
// nothing else emits.
//
// Same defect as #8763's traversal bug (a two-level lookup against a one-node
// compound key), in a compiler rather than in the normalizer.
//
// THE FLAT `set` LEG IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS HERE. It is the spelling an
// operator types, it went through the broken path, and a hierarchical-only
// test would have reported this fixed while `set forwarding-options family
// inet6 mode packet-based` still compiled to "".
