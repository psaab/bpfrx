// #6455 Finding 1 — group-authored duplicate names.
//
// The three pre-expansion duplicate-name gates
// (validateDuplicateNamedBlockAST #5180, validateDuplicateNATRuleNamesAST
// #5649, validateDuplicateNATRuleSetNamesAST #6454) scan only TOP-LEVEL
// stanzas. That is deliberate and still correct for them: apply-groups
// DEEP-MERGES a group-provided named block that has an inline top-level peer,
// so a pre-expansion scan that walked group bodies would count one merged
// object twice.
//
// But a duplicate authored ENTIRELY inside an applied group, with no inline
// peer, is appended wholesale by ast_groups.go and never coalesced. Measured on
// `52f51200e`, this compiled CLEAN and produced a rule-set holding TWO rules
// both named "R":
//
//	groups { G { security { nat { source { rule-set RS {
//	    rule R { then { source-nat { interface; } } }
//	    rule R { then { source-nat { off;       } } }
//	} } } } } }
//	apply-groups G;
//
// while the byte-identical duplicate authored inline is hard-rejected. Same
// config, same compiled shape, opposite verdict, decided by where the operator
// happened to write it.
//
// WHY A PER-GROUP-BODY SCAN IS THE WRONG FIX, since it is the obvious one and
// it was tried and withdrawn in PR #6491. Fragments of ONE named object
// authored across repeated group roots COALESCE under mergeNodes during
// ExpandGroups: two `interfaces` roots each contributing a `ge-0/0/0` unit
// become one interface with two units; an `ids-option P { icmp }` plus an
// `ids-option P { tcp }` become one profile. A pre-expansion sibling-scan
// cannot model that same-pass coalescing, so it rejects configs that compile to
// a single object — unacceptable for a commit gate.
//
// THE FIX runs the SAME three scanners on the EXPANDED tree, where the
// coalescing has already happened. A fragment pair is one node by then and
// reports nothing; a genuinely duplicated pair is still two sibling nodes and
// reports. The scanners are pure functions of a tree, so this reuses them
// verbatim rather than reimplementing the name-keying — which also means the
// two views cannot disagree about what "duplicate" means.
//
// BOTH-NODE UNION. The expansion is done once per cluster node (node0 AND
// node1), mirroring the #5878 / #5879 / #6178 / #6662 union gates and reusing
// their exact clone-and-expand shape (see
// collectNodeExpandedInterfaceUnitSpellings). A `groups node1` body that only
// the PEER's `${node}` expansion selects would otherwise commit green on the
// active node and reach the standby through the tolerant sync path, where it
// only warns. Both views are computed on BOTH physical nodes from the shared
// candidate, so the verdict is a pure function of the candidate and is
// identical on either node.
//
// NOT INCLUDED, deliberately: expandInterfaceRanges is NOT applied to the
// clone (the unit-alias helper does apply it). A range that expands to two
// identical interface names is a different defect on a different axis, nothing
// detects it today, and widening this gate to cover it would be exactly the
// speculative scope that produced the withdrawn false-reject. Leaving it out is
// a non-regression.

// expandedDupNodeViews is the set of cluster-node `${node}` bindings the gate
// expands the candidate under. Both are evaluated on both physical nodes.
var expandedDupNodeViews = []int{0, 1}

// dupNameScannersExpanded is the scanner set re-run on the expanded tree.
//
// It is a slice rather than three inline calls so a fourth pre-expansion
// duplicate-name gate cannot be added to the family without a decision about
// this view: TestDupExpanded6455ScannerSetMatchesPreExpansionFamily pins the
// membership against the pre-expansion call sites.

// cluster node's `${node}` binding, or nil when that node's expansion fails.
//
// A per-node expansion error is non-fatal here and contributes the empty view:
// the real path's own ExpandGroups (compiler.go) owns reporting a broken
// apply-groups reference, and this gate must not turn a diagnostic it does not
// own into a second, differently-worded rejection.

// preWarnings is the lenient-path warning set the three PRE-expansion gates
// already produced for this same candidate. Findings that match one of them are
// dropped, so an inline top-level duplicate — which is present in the expanded
// tree too — is reported exactly once. Deduplication is by the rendered message
// because both views render through the SAME scanner functions, so an identical
// finding produces a byte-identical string by construction; there is no second
// wording to keep in sync.
//
// On the strict path preWarnings is empty and the dedup is a no-op: the
// pre-expansion gates return their error immediately, so reaching this gate at
// all means they found nothing.
//
// Strict returns the first finding as an error, scanning node0's view before
// node1's and each scanner in family order, so the message is deterministic.
