// #7971. Before this file the four `*-regexps` login-class leaves were ACCEPTED
// and silently discarded, while `docs/system-login.md` told operators the
// opposite — that they are "rejected at commit as an unknown leaf rather than
// accepted and ignored — the safe posture for a control that is not
// implemented".
//
// The doc's inference is the part that was wrong. `closedWorld` is opt-in per
// subtree and `system login class` does not set it, so an unmodeled keyword is
// left to the compiler, which drops it. Absence of a schema leaf produces
// silent acceptance, not rejection.
//
// Measured on the real commit path before the fix, with the supported
// `deny-commands` as the accept-side control:
//
//	deny-commands-regexps "^set system"  -> SchemaValidate ACCEPT, nothing retained
//	deny-commands         "^set system"  -> SchemaValidate ACCEPT, DenyCommands retained
//
// Both committed clean; only one did anything. For an access control that is
// the fail-OPEN direction — the operator writes a restriction, sees success,
// and is not restricted.
