// #6779: a VRRP virtual-address set larger than the advertisement's single-byte
// address count (RFC 5798 §5.2.4) makes EVERY advert fail to build — and
// pkg/vrrp sendAdvert discards that Marshal error at slog.Debug. The failure is
// an ORDERING problem: becomeMaster claims the VIPs and publishes MASTER first,
// so the node owns the addresses while advertising nothing. Its peer stops
// hearing a master, promotes itself, and both answer for the same addresses.

// FAIL-ON-REVERT: drop the validateVRRPVIPCountStrict dispatch in
// compiler_uniformgates_cluster_zone.go (or the comparison inside
// vrrpVIPCountErr) and the over-cap subtests below go green on the BAD config.
