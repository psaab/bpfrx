// #8436 batch: `class-of-service` interfaces / schedulers /
// traffic-control-profiles, and `protocols isis interface`.
//
// All four had the shape the census names: a second hierarchical block
// constructed a fresh object and either overwrote the first under one map key
// or appended a second entry with the same name. The flat-set spelling merges,
// so the two spellings of one config disagreed.
//
// EVERY MERGE CELL HERE IS PAIRED WITH A DIFFERENT-NAMES CONTROL, and the
// control is the load-bearing half. Find-or-create is keyed on the NAME, so two
// blocks naming different things still produce two entries — but a merge that
// matched ANY entry rather than the same-named one would pass every merge cell
// while silently configuring one interface where the operator wrote two. That
// over-broad merge is the mirror of the defect and only the control can see it.
//
// The leaf spellings below were verified with single-block compiles before the
// assertions were written (`metric 42` -> Metric=42, `transmit-rate 100m` ->
// 12500000 bytes, `shaping-rate 1g` -> 125000000, `unit 0 shaping-rate 500m` ->
// 62500000). #8587 shipped a fixture whose nested spelling set nothing and
// nearly reported the innocent merge as a second defect; the tell there was
// that the CONTROL failed too.
