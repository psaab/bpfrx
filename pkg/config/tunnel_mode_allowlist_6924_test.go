// #6924 — `tunnel mode <value>` used to accept ANY token. The leaf carried no
// validator, so `tunnel mode banana` committed green, built a kernel GRE device
// (routing/tunnel.go's buildKernelTunnelLink default arm) and carried no
// traffic: an interface an operator can see with nothing going through it.
//
// The allowlist that closes it is a CLAIM about what the dataplane carries, so
// it owes three separate things, and they are three separate tests below:
//
//  1. the claim agrees with the dataplane's own predicate (drift guard);
//  2. an unrecognised value is REJECTED — with a positive control, because a
//     negative cell passes if ANYTHING rejects;
//  3. rejecting at commit does not brick a box that already persisted one
//     (#1960).

// rustTunnelModeKindPath is the dataplane predicate that decides, for real,
// whether a mode carries traffic.
