// #8481: `protocols ospf ... interface <n> interface-type <type>` was declared
// with an arity and a placeholder but NO valueType and NO validator, so
// SchemaValidate accepted any string.
//
// The issue reported the consequence as "commits green and leaves the interface
// on the default broadcast type — adjacency behaviour silently different from
// what was authored". That premise is wrong, and wrong in the DANGEROUS
// direction. `compiler_protocols.go` stores the token verbatim into
// `OSPFInterface.NetworkType`, and `pkg/frr/protocols_render.go` writes it
// verbatim into the managed section:
//
//	fmt.Fprintf(&b, " ip ospf network %s\n", iface.NetworkType)
//
// Measured by rendering the managed section directly, one row per value:
//
//	interface-type "point-to-point"  ->  ip ospf network point-to-point
//	interface-type "p2p"             ->  ip ospf network p2p
//	interface-type "bogus value"     ->  ip ospf network bogus value
//	interface-type ""                ->  (no line)
//
// vtysh rejects a network type it does not know, and ONE rejected line fails
// the ENTIRE managed-section reload (#1880/#2223) — taking down all dynamic
// routing, not just OSPF. That is the same consequence #8443's empty-key guard
// was written for, three lines below this render site in the same file. So the
// leaf is not inert; it is a way to break FRR from a clean commit.
//
// OSPFNetworkTypes is the set vtysh accepts, and it is the set this leaf is
// validated against — the constraint is the CONSUMER's grammar, not anything
// the xpf compiler itself checks (it checks nothing; it passes the token
// through).

//
// This is a deliberate scope choice beyond the issue's suggested shape, and it
// is stated here so it is reviewable rather than incidental. xpf's product
// claim is native Junos configuration syntax, and `interface-type p2p` is what
// Juniper's documentation tells an operator to write. Validating against the
// FRR set ALONE would take today's broken-reload and turn it into a hard
// rejection of valid Junos syntax — better than breaking FRR, but still a
// refusal of the exact spelling the product claims to accept. Translating them
// is what makes the leaf behave the way the rest of the tree does.
//
// The three aliases are the complete Junos set for this statement. Junos also
// spells `broadcast` and `point-to-point` the FRR way, so those need no entry
// and deliberately have none — an alias table that repeats identity mappings
// invites a later reader to treat absence as an oversight.
