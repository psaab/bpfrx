// #8928: eliding a container drops its child BEFORE strict validation runs, so
// a dangling cross-reference commits clean — the elision suppresses its own
// detector.
//
// `services ip-monitoring` was one of the issue's two named instances and was
// recorded there as fixed. It was not: measured at master, the braced spelling
// rejected a typo'd rpm-probe and the elided spelling committed clean.
//
// THE CHAIN, which is why the pair was already admitted and still inert — the
// #8858 shape:
//
//	services      -> ip-monitoring   ADMITTED
//	ip-monitoring -> policy          MISSING     <- the break
//	match         -> rpm-probe       ADMITTED    (unreachable below the break)
//
// Only the missing link is added. `policy -> match` is deliberately NOT
// admitted: that pair is effective at THREE schema sites — `security policies
// from-zone <n> policy`, `security policies global policy` and `services
// ip-monitoring policy` — so admitting it would change security-policy
// compilation to fix an ip-monitoring defect. It is not needed: the body from
// `match` inward is already braced in the reachable spelling. That multi-site
// hazard is #8921's subject, and this change is scoped to stay out of it.
