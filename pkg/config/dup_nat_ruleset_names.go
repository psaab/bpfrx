// natRuleSetSubBlocks lists the NAT sub-blocks whose rule-SETS carry a named
// operational identity that must be unique within the sub-block's natType
// namespace. It EXTENDS natRuleSubBlocks (source / destination / static — the
// rule-NAME axis of #5649) with nat64: a nat64 rule-set carries prefix /
// source-pool and NO `rule` nodes (correctly excluded from the #5649 rule-name
// gate), but its NAME is still the operational identity, so a duplicated nat64
// rule-set name is its own fail-open worth catching (#6454). natv6v4 /
// proxy-arp are excluded: neither is a named first-match rule-set.
var natRuleSetSubBlocks = []string{"source", "destination", "static", "nat64"}

// dupNATRuleSet is one detected duplicate rule-set name within one NAT type.

// validateDuplicateNATRuleSetNamesAST rejects (strict) or warns (lenient) when
// the candidate authors the SAME rule-set name twice within one NAT type. This
// is the #5649 (C181-M18) duplicate-NAT-rule-name defect one level up — the
// rule-SET axis (#6454).
//
// A NAT rule-set name is its operational identity: the from/to scope binding
// and the CLI show key. The name is UNIQUE per nat type but reusable ACROSS nat
// types — Junos gives source / destination / static / nat64 independent name
// spaces (NATCounterKey in pkg/dataplane/compiler_nat.go is natType-prefixed for
// the counted types), so the same rule-set name in two DIFFERENT nat types is a
// distinct identity and legitimate; only the same name WITHIN one nat type
// collides. Two same-named rule-sets do NOT reduce to last-writer-wins like a
// #5180 hierarchical block — they BOTH survive: compileNATSource /
// compileNATDestination / compileNATStatic / compileNAT64 each APPEND the
// rule-set (sec.NAT.Source / Destination.RuleSets / Static / NAT64), never
// merging by name, so both compile as separate first-match tables sharing one
// name. The operator authored what they read as one rule-set; it compiles to
// two, evaluated in sequence. The CLI named-rule-set show lookup (e.g.
// showNATSourceRuleSet in pkg/cli/cli_show_nat.go) returns on the FIRST name
// match, so the second same-named rule-set — and its rules — is invisible on
// that surface and the operator cannot disambiguate the two.
//
// This is NOT a per-rule counter merge: NATCounterKey INCLUDES the rule name, so
// the disjoint rules this gate uniquely catches (rule R1 in the first RS, rule
// R2 in the second) get DISTINCT counter keys and never share a hit counter — a
// SAME rule name in both rule-sets is caught first by the #5649 rule-NAME gate.
// The genuine, type-independent defect is the shared rule-set NAME identity, so
// the diagnostic is deliberately type-agnostic and never claims a per-rule
// counter (a nat64 rule-set is counter-less anyway).
//
// Runs PRE-expansion on top-level `security` stanzas only, exactly like
// validateDuplicateNATRuleNamesAST (#5649) and validateDuplicateNamedBlockAST
// (#5180): apply-groups DEEP-MERGES a same-named rule-set rather than duplicating
// it, and a rule-set authored once via flat `set` reuses its rule-set node
// (tree.SetPath merges), so only a directly-authored hierarchical duplicate
// reaches here. The seen-set is keyed by (natType, ruleSet) and unioned across
// repeated `security` / `nat` / sub-block stanzas — compileNAT (#3915) merges
// those repeats — so a rule-set name split across two `source {}` blocks is caught
// too. A quoted-empty rule-set name is recorded as an empty-name defect (#6455)
// rather than skipped — this gate OWNS the empty rule-set name (the #5649
// rule-name gate skips an empty rule-set so the warning is not double-reported).
// Crucially the dedup is at the AST rule-set-INSTANCE level, NOT the compiled
// level: a single authored rule-set carrying a bracket list of from/to scopes
// (#3096) Cartesian-expands into MULTIPLE same-named NATRuleSet objects downstream
// — that legitimate expansion is one AST instance and is NOT flagged. Strict
// rejects on the operator commit / commit-check path; lenient (Load / peer-sync,
// #1960) warns and keeps the historical two-table behavior.
//
// A duplicate authored ENTIRELY inside an applied group body is NOT caught here —
// this gate is pre-expansion by design; it is caught by
// validateDuplicateNamesExpandedAST (dup_names_expanded_6455.go, #6455
// Finding 1), which re-runs THIS function on a group-expanded clone.
