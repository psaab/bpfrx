// wildcard_keyvalidator_inventory_6844_test.go -- #6844.
//
// #6844 made SchemaValidate run a keyValidator on a WILDCARD TYPED LEAF's
// keyword. #6834 had already done so for wildcard CONTAINERS; the typed-leaf
// branch returns before that rule was reached, so a wildcard typed leaf
// validated its VALUE and never its identity.
//
// That is a change to a shared gate, so its blast radius is enumerated here
// rather than left to be discovered. Every leaf in this list newly gained
// identity validation, and any leaf ADDED to the set later shows up as a diff
// in this test rather than as a config that stops committing in the field.

// collectWildcardTypedLeafKeyValidators walks setSchema for the exact shape the
// #6844 rule newly reaches.
