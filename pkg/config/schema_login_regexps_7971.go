// #7971: the Junos `*-regexps` login-class family is NOT implemented, and until
// this file it was ACCEPTED AND SILENTLY DISCARDED.
//
// `docs/system-login.md` asserted the opposite, and asserted it as the safety
// argument: "There is no schema leaf, so a `-regexps` statement is rejected at
// commit as an unknown leaf rather than accepted and ignored — the safe posture
// for a control that is not implemented." So did #7971 itself.
//
// The inference is what was wrong, not the intent. A leaf the schema does not
// model is NOT rejected: `closedWorld` is opt-in per subtree (schema.go), and
// `system login class` does not set it, so `SchemaValidate` leaves an unmodeled
// keyword to the compiler and the compiler drops it. Measured on the real commit
// path before this change:
//
//	set system login class limited deny-commands-regexps "^set system"
//	  -> SchemaValidate ACCEPT, CompileConfig ok, nothing retained,
//	     and the only warning is the generic "custom RBAC recognized" line
//	     that fires identically for the supported `deny-commands` control.
//
// That is the fail-OPEN direction for an access control: the operator authors a
// restriction, sees a clean commit, and gets no restriction. It is strictly
// worse than the missing feature, because the missing feature is at least
// visible.
//
// This file makes the documented posture TRUE rather than implementing the
// family. Implementing it is a separate, larger decision (#7971 item 1) and must
// not be done by halves: the two families have OPPOSITE allow/deny precedence
// (plain: allow wins; `-regexps`: deny wins) and different matching subjects
// (`-regexps` matches the command's full path), so reusing the plain family's
// logic yields a `deny-commands-regexps` that loses to an
// `allow-commands-regexps` — a privilege escalation delivered by what looks like
// reuse of tested code. `LoginRegexFamily.IdenticalPatternWinner`
// (login_regex.go, #7172) already carries precedence as per-family DATA for that
// reason; nothing here consumes it, and nothing here should.
//
// Strict commit REJECTS; the tolerant Load/SyncApply path downgrades to a
// warning as every schema validator does (#1319 PR 2 / #1960), so a persisted or
// peer-synced config carrying one of these leaves does not brick the daemon.
