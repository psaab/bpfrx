// Tests for #6659 (fail-open half): compiler arms that read only ONE side of a
// dual-shape multi-value leaf, so a bracketed list or a packed statement
// silently compiled to one value — or to none.
//
// CLAUDE.md states the rule: "A compiler reading a multi-value leaf MUST read
// child.Keys[1:] AND child.Children and accumulate." These five arms did not.
// They are grouped here because each one is a FAIL-OPEN — the dropped value
// either widens what a rule matches, or escapes the commit gate that exists to
// reject it — as opposed to the pure value-drops tracked separately on #6659.
//
// THE ONE-SIDEDNESS RUNS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. This is the property that makes the
// class recur, and it defeats the obvious fix strategy:
//
//   - some arms read Children and NEVER Keys[1:] — `attributes-match` and
//     `then change-configuration commands` here, which is why their PACKED-LEAF
//     spellings compiled to nothing while the block spellings worked;
//   - other arms read Keys[1:] and NEVER Children — the CoS `code-points`
//     collector (not in this PR) reads Keys plus the inline tail, so its
//     hierarchical BLOCK spelling loses the entire classifier.
//
// Anyone fixing this class by pattern-matching "looks like a nodeVal call" finds
// only the first direction and leaves the mirror image untouched. The check that
// actually works is per-shape: compile BOTH the bracketed/packed spelling AND the
// hierarchical block spelling and compare, which is what every test below does.
//
// Two distinct fail-open shapes appear below, do NOT conflate them:
//
//   - MATCH-WIDENING (attributes-match). Dropping the values makes the rule
//     match MORE than the operator wrote: an event policy with no
//     attributes-match fires on every occurrence of the event.
//   - GATE-ESCAPE (flow flag, static-NAT destination-address,
//     forwarding-table export). A commit-time validator walked the same one
//     side the compiler did, so an INVALID value in any slot but the first
//     committed CLEAN. Each of these has a paired "bogus value in slot 2"
//     assertion — that half is the actual defect, and a fix that only restores
//     the value without extending the gate would leave it open. What the escape
//     COSTS differs per site and is stated at each test rather than assumed
//     uniform: for static-NAT `match destination-address` it is a lost
//     DIAGNOSTIC, not a dataplane fail-open, because only the first prefix is
//     ever lowered (see
//     TestStaticNATMatchAddresses6659TolerantPathValidatesEveryPrefix).
//
// Per CLAUDE.md, every flat-set case is built with ParseSetCommand +
// tree.SetPath, never NewParser (which merges all set lines into one node).

// TestEventMultiValueLeaf6673TokenBoundaryBothParsers is the #6673 fold's
// discriminator guard, and the reason the fold did not take the obvious fix.
//
// The obvious fix for the fused flat-set bracket is to declare `commands` and
// `attributes-match` `multi: true` in setSchema, so SetPath absorbs the bracket
// onto the node's own tail the way the hierarchical parser already does. That
// is measurably wrong on three counts and none of them is visible from the
// bracket case alone:
//
//  1. `multi` makes SetPath append a bracket's members to the node's Keys, so
//     `commands set system host-name foo` — an unquoted command — also lands on
//     the tail, where the per-token read shatters it into four bare words.
//  2. `multi` makes REPEATED flat-set statements distinct SIBLING nodes rather
//     than merging into one node's children, and compileEventOptions reaches
//     `commands` through ccNode.FindChild (singular), so every sibling after
//     the first is silently dropped — worse than master.
//  3. It cannot repair a config ALREADY PERSISTED in the child shape: the
//     configstore deserializes Nodes straight from JSON and SetPath never runs,
//     so the fused read would survive a reload of the very configs the fold
//     exists to fix.
//
// So the boundary is decided in the READER, once, for both the tail and the
// children — and this table is what pins it. The last group is the over-reach
// guard: a quoted VALUE inside an otherwise unquoted statement must stay part
// of ONE value. That is what rules out the simpler "any token containing a
// space means the group is a list" discriminator.

// event-options `attributes-match` (compiler_services.go:1914), proxy-ARP
// `address` (compiler_nat_source.go:160) and static-NAT `match
// destination-address` (compiler_nat_static.go:750). NOT exercised:
// EventPolicy.ThenCommands, TraceOptions.Flags and
// RoutingOptionsConfig.ForwardingTableExports — the last two are single-instance
// leaves (one `traceoptions` block per section; one global `forwarding-table
// export`) so the two-sibling probe this test is built on cannot be written for
// them at all, but ThenCommands CAN have siblings and simply is not covered
// here. For all three the argument is the structural one below, unverified by a
// probe.
//
// On #6391 a fan that stored ONE parsed *HostInboundTraffic under N map keys
// aliased a single value across all of them, because mergeHostInbound returns
// src unchanged when dst is nil — so a later in-place merge on one key surfaced
// on the others. That hazard needs two ingredients: a shared STRUCT POINTER, and
// a mutator that writes through it.

// (EventPolicy.AttributesMatch / ThenCommands, TraceOptions.Flags,
// ProxyARPEntry.Addresses, StaticNATRule.MatchAddresses,
// RoutingOptionsConfig.ForwardingTableExports) filled by spread-appending a
// FRESHLY RETURNED slice, so `append` copies the elements and the strings are
// immutable; and the two scalars (Match, ForwardingTableExport) are string copies
// of index 0, not slice aliases. That is a structural argument, so this test
