// #6782 — an invalid RETH redundancy-group commits as a non-HA address owned
// by BOTH nodes.
//
// compileInterfaces reads the token with `if v, err := strconv.Atoi(...);
// err == nil`, so a non-numeric token leaves the group at its 0 default and a
// negative one is stored verbatim. Every downstream consumer decides "is this a
// RETH?" with `redundancy-group > 0` (pkg/dataplane compiler_iface.go sets both
// isReth and isVRRPReth that way), so a non-positive group makes the interface
// read as ORDINARY: the 169.254.RG.NODE/32 link-local substitution does not
// fire and the reth's real service address is written onto the physical device.
// Both nodes share the synced config, so both configure it.
//
// These bind the gate AND the tolerant-path behaviour, in both directions.

// rethRGSet builds a minimal committable cluster config carrying one reth whose
// redundancy-group token is tok.
//
// The auth key is present because chassis-cluster commit independently requires
// one — without it every strict compile fails on THAT gate and a test asserting
// "strict rejects" would pass for the wrong reason.
