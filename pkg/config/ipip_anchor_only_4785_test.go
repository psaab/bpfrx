// #4785 fold F2 + F3: the anchor-only advisory.

// F2 (a REGRESSION this PR introduced). The #4788 advisory it replaced walked
// UNITS as well as interfaces. The replacement examined only `iface.Tunnel`,
// while daemon collection (collectAppliedTunnels, pkg/daemon/daemon_run_routehelpers.go)
// applies EVERY non-nil `unit.Tunnel` with no completeness screen at all and
// routing then creates a mode-independent Tuntap anchor. So
//
//	set interfaces ip-0/0/0 unit 5 tunnel destination 10.0.0.2
//
// emitted nothing (the emitter suppresses a non-WireGuard endpoint missing
// either half), which is exactly why the strict gate is silent for it by
// design — and it also produced NO advisory, while still creating a visible
// `ip-0-0-0u5` device carrying nothing. Neither rejection nor alarm, which
// contradicts the reason the advisory is registered at all.
//
// F3 (wrong cause in a diagnostic). The advisory always said "no tunnel endpoint
// is emitted for the interface-level stanza (every unit overrides it)". For a
// source-only interface stanza with NO units that diagnosis is false and its
// per-unit remediation is the wrong advice.

// ipipWarningsFor compiles and returns the ValidateConfig warnings mentioning
// ipip — the REAL alarm entry point, not ipipAnchorOnlyWarnings directly. The
// alarm surfaces (`show system alarms`, gRPC, the two security-alarm views)
// recompute ValidateConfig from the ACTIVE config, so that is the path that has
// to carry the advisory.

// are separate properties and need separate fixtures.
//
// The discriminator needs an emitted record that is NOT `t` yet shares `t.Name`,
// with `t.Name` absent from the live device set so the device clause cannot be
// what decides. Two TunnelConfig records share a Name only via:
//
//   - an interface-level record and its own unit 0 (both `LinuxIfName(ifName)`)
//     — but TunnelNameMap resolves that unit ref to exactly that name, so the
//     device clause suppresses it first and the keying never decides; or
//   - two DIFFERENT interface keys collapsing to one Linux name, since
//     LinuxIfName only replaces '/' with '-'. `gr-0/0-0` is a one-character slip
//     from `gr-0/0/0` and both canonicalize to `gr-0-0-0`.
//
// The second is this fixture, combined with the one shape whose emitted device
// diverges from its record's Name: interface-level WireGuard whose lowest unit
// is > 0. The emitter publishes the INTERFACE pointer at ref `gr-0/0/0.1`
// (#1910) while TunnelNameMap resolves that ref to the UNIT device
// `gr-0-0-0u1`, so `gr-0-0-0` is emitted-by-name but absent from `live`.
//
// SCOPE, stated plainly: a strict commit REJECTS this config — the duplicate
// Linux-device-name gate fires on `gr-0/0-0` vs `gr-0/0/0`. So on any config
// that can be committed the two keyings are equivalent, and the pointer clause
// buys nothing there. It is load-bearing on the TOLERANT surface instead
// (#1960): configstore's Load/SyncApply lenient-compiles a config a strict
// commit would refuse, and `show system` renders ValidateConfig's warnings for
// whatever is active. On that path name-keying silently drops a real dead ipip
// anchor because an unrelated interface happens to canonicalize to the same
// device name. Pointer keying is correct without depending on another gate
// staying in place, which is why it is kept.
//
// WHAT THIS FIXTURE ESTABLISHES, exactly (#6861 re-gate B2). It proves IDENTITY
// SEMANTICS versus NAME KEYING: there is one emitted reference, its record is a
// DIFFERENT object from the candidate, the two Names are equal, and that Name is
// absent from the live device set — so a name-keyed set suppresses a warning
// that an identity-keyed one raises. It does NOT prove that a literal Go pointer
// is the only implementation; any keying on record identity would do, and
// deleting the emitted clause outright still produces the warning (its sibling
// TestIpipEmittedRecordIsNeverAlsoAnAnchor_6861 is what catches that deletion,
// deliberately — existence and keying are separate properties).
//
// AND ITS RENDERED REMEDIATION IS NOT ACCURATE FOR THIS SHAPE. The advisory
// tells the operator that removing the interface-level `tunnel` stanza would
// drop the anchor. Here it would not: collectAppliedTunnels submits both the
// unrelated interface WireGuard record and this IPIP record under the same base
// device, routing reconciles every record, so the WireGuard record retains or
// recreates that TUN. The device is SHARED, not uniquely created by the IPIP
// site. The wording is written for the committable single-owner case and this
// fixture is reachable only on the tolerant surface; it is recorded here rather
// than rewritten because the assertion under test is the KEYING, and narrowing
// the shared production text for a tolerant-only shape is a separate change.
//
// RED-on-revert: re-key the clause to a name-keyed set
// (`!emittedName[t.Name]`, built from the same EmitTunnelEndpointNames walk)
// and this fails at "the anchor advisory did not fire".
