// #8258 starting point 3, and the hole it found in starting point 1.
//
// `ast_secret_redaction_census_8258_test.go` enumerates its population by
// REFLECTION over `Secret`-typed fields, and its commit argued that reflection
// beats the source scan #8104 had to use because "the population is a TYPE, so
// reflection enumerates it exactly. No wrapper can hide from it."
//
// That was wrong in a specific way, and #8258's own starting point 3 —
// "anything with a `MarshalJSON` that transforms a value" — is what surfaced
// it. `SNMPCommunity.Name` is declared `string`. It becomes a `Secret` only
// inside `MarshalJSON`/`MarshalYAML`, by conversion:
//
//	return json.Marshal(alias{Name: Secret(c.Name), ...})
//
// So the typed route DOES redact it, exactly as if the field were declared
// `Secret` — and the reflection census cannot see it, because at the type level
// the field is a plain string. The SNMP v1/v2c community string is the
// v1/v2c AUTHENTICATOR, so this is not an obscure corner.
//
// This is the identical trap #8104's own census comment records and warns
// about, arriving from the other direction:
//
//	"defining a set as 'things that call X' is a CLAIM that X is the only
//	route to the behaviour."
//
// Defining a set as "things whose TYPE is X" is the same claim. A conversion is
// a route to the behaviour that the type does not record. Reflection is exact
// about the question it answers; the error was in believing that question was
// the whole population.
//
// This file closes the gap by enumerating the OTHER route with `go/ast` rather
// than a regex — a conversion `Secret(x.F)` inside a method is a syntactic
// fact, so it can be extracted precisely instead of pattern-matched. Both
// censuses feed the same map, so a leaf enrolled by either route is verified
// the same way.

// secretCoercionCensus parses the config package and returns every
// "TypeName.FieldName" that is CONVERTED to `Secret` inside a method, which is
// how a field that is not declared `Secret` still redacts on the typed route.
//
// Scoped to method bodies with a receiver so the result can be reported as
// Type.Field, matching the reflection census's vocabulary. A conversion of
// something that is not a plain field selector on the receiver (a local, a
// literal, a nested expression) is not reported — those cannot be named in the
// same vocabulary, and the completeness check below is what catches one
// appearing.
