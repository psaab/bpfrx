// #9157 — `interfaces <*> tunnel keepalive-retry` was the only UNTYPED leaf
// among four typed siblings.
//
// `key`, `ttl` and `keepalive` each declare `valueType: ValueInteger` plus an
// explicit `ValidateInteger` range; `keepalive-retry` declared neither, and
// schema_walk.go builds a value checker exactly when `n.validator != nil`, so
// the leaf was walked and waved through.
//
// THE HARM IS REACHABILITY, NOT OVERFLOW. `keepaliveLoop` transitions the
// tunnel down at `state.Failures >= state.MaxRetries`
// (pkg/routing/tunnel_keepalive_runner.go), `Failures` increments once per probe
// tick, and `startKeepalive` normalizes only `<= 0 -> 3`. So a value large
// enough makes that comparison unreachable: a GRE keepalive the operator
// enabled never declares the tunnel down, the anchor stays up, and static routes
// over it keep forwarding into a dead peer. The reachable spelling is
// `set … tunnel keepalive 30 keepalive-retry 99999999999`, because the runner is
// gated on `tc.Keepalive > 0`.
//
// The second half is the typo: `abc` parsed to 0 through a discarded
// `strconv.Atoi` error and became the runtime default 3, so a mistyped value was
// silently a working config rather than a commit error.

// keepaliveRetryTree9157 builds the flat-set candidate an operator types.
