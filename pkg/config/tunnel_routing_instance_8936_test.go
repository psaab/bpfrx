// TestTunnelRoutingInstanceSpellingsAgree8936 pins the fix for the one site
// where the #8690 register's `partial` class was load-bearing.
//
// `partial` records that SOMETHING CONSUMED THE TAIL and infers that it was
// ENTITLED to. Here the consumer was the defect: the braced spelling gives
// `routing-instance` a CHILD named `destination`, while the elided spelling
// packs the tail onto the node's own Keys, so FindChild returned nil and the
// fallback nodeVal(prop) returned Keys[1] -- the literal keyword "destination".
//
// The tunnel compiled with RoutingInstance="destination", bound to a
// routing-instance that does not exist, and the operator's instance name was
// discarded. That is WORSE than a drop: a missing value leaves the tunnel
// visibly unbound, while this produced a plausible binding that resolves to
// nothing.
//
// Three spellings, because the fix has to leave the other two alone -- a repair
// that made the elided form right by breaking `routing-instance <name>;` would
// pass a two-spelling cell.
