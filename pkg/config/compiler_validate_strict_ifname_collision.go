// maxLinuxIfNameLen is the longest interface name the Linux kernel accepts: a
// netdev name must fit in IFNAMSIZ (16) INCLUDING the trailing NUL, so the
// usable name is at most 15 bytes. A configured interface whose canonical Linux
// name exceeds this cannot be created by the kernel (the `.link` rename fails),
// so the interface — and its zone / routing identity — silently never
// materializes.
const maxLinuxIfNameLen = 15

// validateInterfaceNameCollisionStrict rejects a config in which two DISTINCT
// authored interface names canonicalize (via LinuxIfName) to the SAME Linux
// device name, or in which an authored name's canonical Linux name exceeds the
// kernel IFNAMSIZ limit (#5832).
//
// LinuxIfName only replaces '/' with '-' (types.go), which is NOT injective:
// the distinct authored names `ge-0/0/0` and `ge-0-0-0` both map to the Linux
// device `ge-0-0-0` — the same ifindex. Each authored interface still emits its
// OWN logical row into the Go forwarding snapshot (its own security zone,
// routing-instance, host-inbound, NAT, address, and tunnel metadata), but the
// Rust forwarding-state builder keys those rows by ifindex and OVERWRITES the
// earlier one. Because the snapshot is walked in Go's sorted-name order, the
// lexicographically LATER colliding name deterministically wins — SILENTLY
// changing the security zone and routing identity of every packet on that
// shared Linux device, with no commit-time signal.
//
// This is a silent zone/routing hijack, so it is a strict COMMIT REJECTION on
// the CompileConfig path (interactive / gRPC commit + commit-check): the
// operator sees the collision before it can take effect. The call site
// (runUniformGates) downgrades it to a WARNING on the tolerant load / peer-sync
// paths (opts.lenientIfNameCollision) so an already-committed or peer-synced
// config that predates this gate still boots (#1960 no-brick) — but the warning
// names which authored name wins so the silent overwrite becomes visible.
//
// The fix is a GATE, not a remapping: LinuxIfName's mapping is unchanged, so
// every existing single-name config (the overwhelming common case, where an
// authored name has no colliding sibling) compiles exactly as before.
//
// #6964 — THE AUTHORED SET IS NOT THE DEVICE SET. An authored interface name is
// not the only way a kernel device name enters the config. A logical unit that
// carries its own `tunnel` stanza gets its OWN Linux device, named by the
// compiler as the interface's canonical name plus "u<unit>" for unit > 0
// (compiler_interfaces.go, stored verbatim in unit.Tunnel.Name). So the DERIVED
// device name of `gr-0/0/0 unit 1` is `gr-0-0-0u1`, which is byte-identical to
// the canonical name of an interface an operator is free to author as
// `gr-0/0/0u1` — `u` and digits are ordinary allowed characters
// (ValidateInterfaceName, #6834), and the two AUTHORED keys (`gr-0/0/0u1` and
// `gr-0/0/0`) are distinct, so the authored-only walk above never sees them
// touch.
//
// Measured on origin/master before this gate was widened: that pair compiles
// with err == nil and yields TWO *TunnelConfig records carrying the SAME
// Name="gr-0-0-0u1" and DIFFERENT Source/Destination.
//
// The consequence is at the ROUTING layer. pkg/routing keys ALL of its
// per-device state by TunnelConfig.Name: the desired/owned set
// (`desired[tc.Name]`), the applied-address set (`appliedAddrs[tc.Name]`), the
// VRF claim (`appliedRI[tc.Name]`), and the keepalive runner. So the two
// records collapse to ONE entry in `desired` and then reconcile the SAME device
// TWICE within one Apply. The second pass runs reconcileLinkAddrsLocked against
// the first pass's applied set, which AddrDels every non-link-local address on
// the device that is absent from the second record's Addresses — the two
// records delete each other's addresses off the shared device — and rewrites
// its VRF claim and keepalive runner on top.
//
// And which record is "second" is not fixed: collectAppliedTunnels (pkg/daemon)
// walks the cfg.Interfaces.Interfaces MAP, and BOTH orders were observed within
// a single process (174/26 over 200 calls). So this is not merely "one config
// silently wins" — there is no stable winner.
//
// Scope of that claim, checked rather than assumed: the endpoint-comparing
// delete+recreate in applyKernelTunnelLocked (legacyTunnelMatches) is NOT the
// production path. The daemon always sets AnchorOnly, so applyAnchorLocked runs
// instead, and anchorReusable ignores tunnel endpoints — the TUN is reused in
// place. The name-keyed address / VRF / keepalive overwrite above is common to
// both paths; the additional link flap belongs to the standalone-CLI path only.
//
// So the gate compares the EFFECTIVE DEVICE-NAME SET: every authored canonical
// name PLUS every per-unit tunnel device name. Both halves share the strict /
// lenient split, so a config already committed with this shape still boots with
// a warning naming the collision rather than bricking (#1960).

	// That choice is load-bearing rather than stylistic. The issue describes

	//     pass already claimed that name for this same interface, so reporting
	//     it would reject every ordinary `unit 0` in the tree — the
	//     over-rejection this gate must not commit.
	//   - a unit carrying a tunnel. The resolver returns unit.Tunnel.Name for
	//     those, so pass 2 has already adjudicated the identical name; running
