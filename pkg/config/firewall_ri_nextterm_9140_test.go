// #9140 (security, filter fail-open): `then routing-instance <x>` is a
// TERMINATING filter-based-forwarding action, so co-locating it with
// `then next term` is the same contradiction #5142 rejects for
// accept/discard/reject — reached through a different typed field.
//
// compileFilterThen records accept/reject/discard on term.TerminalActions but
// records the FBF steer on term.RoutingInstance, and the #5142 gate tested only
// `len(term.TerminalActions) > 0`. So
//
//	then { routing-instance mgmt-vrf; next term; }
//
// committed cleanly and then rendered a TERMINATING accept in BOTH runtimes
// (userspace-dp/src/filter/compiler.rs sets
// `continue_term: action.is_empty() && routing_instance.is_empty()` and resolves
// the empty action to Accept; the kernel lo0 nft mirror emits `accept` — pinned
// by TestNftRuleFromTermRoutingInstanceTerminatesAccept in pkg/daemon). On lo0,
// the host control-plane filter, that makes every later deny term unreachable
// for the steer term's whole match set.
//
// The runtimes AGREE and are not the defect: changing either one alone would
// break the kernel/userspace mirror contract stated in
// pkg/daemon/daemon_nft_term_lower.go. The defect is that the operator could
// author the contradiction at all.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore the gate to `term.NextTerm && len(term.TerminalActions) > 0`
// and TestFilterRoutingInstancePlusNextTerm_9140 goes RED — CompileConfig
// accepts the contradiction again.

// buildRIFilterTree defines the routing instance the filter steers into, so the
// term clears validateFilterRoutingInstanceReferenceStrict and the test is
// measuring the next-term gate rather than an undefined-instance rejection.
