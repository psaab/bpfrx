// compiler_chassis_monitor_weight.go carries the #6588 commit-side gate for a
// redundancy-group monitor weight that is present but UNUSABLE — malformed, or
// specified twice with different values.
//
// Why an AST pre-walk rather than a typed schema leaf or a compiled-struct
// check:
//
//   - The typed-leaf route is closed. `interface-monitor` packs
//     `<ifname> weight <n>` onto ONE node key, so schema_chassis.go declares it
//     `children: nil` (typing the weight would need a children/wildcard map,
//     which flips SetPath's replace-vs-container grouping). SchemaValidate
//     therefore never reaches the weight token at all — and for the PACKED
//     spelling it does not reach the ip-monitoring weights either, which sit
//     below the depth its walk descends.
//
//   - The compiled struct cannot tell these cases apart. compileChassis parses
//     the weight with strconv.Atoi and, on failure, leaves the pre-existing 0
//     default. `weight nope` and `weight 0` and no weight at all are all
//     Weight==0 by the time validateChassisClusterStrict sees them, so the
//     #6549 range gate — which is otherwise the right layer, and which #6588
//     extended to ip-monitoring — structurally cannot flag a parse failure.
//
// Both problems are the same class as the packed-statement drop this file's
// issue is about: the operator configures a monitor, `commit` succeeds with no
// error and no warning, and the redundancy group carries LESS demotion debt
// than was written — `interface-monitor ge-0/0/0 weight nope;` installs a
// monitor whose weight is 0, so the link going down demotes the group by
// nothing and failover does not happen.
//
// Duplicates were additionally SHAPE-DEPENDENT before this gate:
// `weight 100 weight 200` inline compiled to 200 (the inline scan overwrote)
// while `{ weight 100; weight 200; }` compiled to 100 (FindChild returns the
// first). The compiler is now uniformly first-wins via monitorWeightTokens, and
// this gate rejects the duplicate outright so the operator is never relying on
// which spelling they happened to use.
//
// Strictness follows the sibling chassis gates: hard-reject at commit /
// commit-check, downgrade to a cfg.Warnings entry on the tolerant load /
// peer-sync paths (#1960 no-brick) — an already-persisted or peer-pushed config
// an older binary accepted must still BOOT. The compiled 0 default is what the
// tolerant path keeps, now flagged rather than silent.

// validateMonitorWeightTokensAST walks the chassis cluster subtree and reports
// every redundancy-group monitor weight that is present but unusable. It runs
// on the group-expanded tree so an apply-groups-inherited weight is covered.
//
// It derives its entries from monitorEntryNodes / monitorWeightTokens — the
// same readers compileChassis uses — so the gate and the compiler cannot drift
// apart about which token is a weight, which entry it belongs to, or how a
// bracketed list splits.
//
// Returns (warnings, nil) when lenient, (nil, error) on the first offender when
// strict.
