// Routing-protocol `authentication-type` canonicalization — #8443.
//
// `protocols isis authentication-type` and `protocols rip authentication-type`
// (and the per-interface IS-IS copy, and both routing-instance copies) were
// untyped in setSchema, so ANY string committed. The FRR renderers then act on
// the literal `"md5"` and treat everything else as the weak arm:
//
//	RIP          `ip rip authentication mode md5`   else  `mode text`
//	IS-IS area   `area-password md5`                else  `area-password clear`
//	IS-IS iface  `isis password md5`                else  `isis password clear`
//
// So a one-character typo does not remove authentication — it SILENTLY
// DOWNGRADES md5 to plaintext, with the operator's key on the wire in the clear
// while `show configuration` still says md5. The issue that filed this claimed
// the adjacency came up unauthenticated; that is not what the code does, and
// the `else` arms predate the commit the issue verified against.
//
// OSPF is deliberately NOT served by this canonicalizer. It uses a different
// grammar — a nested `authentication { md5 <id> { key ...; } | simple-password
// ...; }` block whose AuthType is assigned only from matched keywords
// (`compiler_protocols.go:147,159`), so it cannot hold a free-form value at
// all. Widening this domain to cover OSPF's spellings would relax the strict
// one for no gain; OSPF's own defects are separate and handled separately.

// authTypeSpellings maps every accepted operator spelling to its canonical
// form. Junos writes `md5` and `simple`; FRR's RIP spelling for the plaintext
// arm is `text`, which this product emits, so it is accepted as a synonym
// rather than rejected — refusing the vocabulary of our own output is a
// surprising failure mode (the same reasoning that admits `level-2-only` in
// CanonicalISISLevel).

// plaintext today against a peer expecting plaintext would flip to md5 on
// upgrade and the adjacency would drop, turning a silent downgrade into a
// silent outage on the very path whose purpose is that a persisted config still

// #9105: AN ABSENT TYPE AND A CHOSEN PLAINTEXT TYPE WERE THE SAME STATE at the
// render sites, and the renderers could not tell them apart:
//
//	AuthType=""        Unrecognized=false  IsMD5=false  -> renders CLEAR  (SILENT)
//	AuthType="simple"  Unrecognized=false  IsMD5=false  -> renders CLEAR  (SILENT)
//	AuthType="md5"     Unrecognized=false  IsMD5=true   -> renders md5    (SILENT)
//	AuthType="bogus"   Unrecognized=true   IsMD5=false  -> renders CLEAR  (warned)
//
// Look at the `simple` row: it renders `clear` silently and that is CORRECT --
// the operator asked for plaintext. The empty string takes the identical path,
// so "the operator chose plaintext" and "the type was dropped upstream" are
// indistinguishable at the point of decision. No amount of care at the render
// site could have caught it; the information was destroyed before the renderer
// ran.
//
// WHY IT IS A DOWNGRADE AND NOT A LOSS. Authentication stays ON -- the
// area/domain password is still emitted and adjacencies still authenticate,
// with the key in cleartext in every PDU. An operator verifying that
// adjacencies are authenticated sees exactly that, and `show configuration`
// echoes back the `md5` they wrote. A dropped-authentication defect is noisy:
// adjacencies fail. This one succeeds.
//
// This predicate does NOT change what an absent type MEANS -- CanonicalAuthType
// still canonicalizes "" to DefaultAuthType, and the tolerant path still
// renders plaintext rather than flipping a running adjacency to md5 on upgrade
// (the reasoning AuthTypeIsMD5 records). It only lets a caller ASK whether a
// type was authored, which is the question the render sites needed and could
// not put.
