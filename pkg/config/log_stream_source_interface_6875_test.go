// #6875: `security log stream <name> source-interface <x>` committed clean and
// did nothing. `source-interface` was modelled only under `security log` (top
// level); the `stream` subtree is OPEN-WORLD, so the per-stream spelling parsed
// as an unmodelled keyword, `SyslogStream` had no field to receive it, and
// nothing read it. The operator saw a clean commit and the stream sourced from
// the global setting or from nothing.
//
// Disposition taken: ACCEPT AND IMPLEMENT (option 2 of the issue). The apply
// path already resolved a per-stream `source-address` with a global fallback,
// so this is a bounded thread rather than new machinery — which is what made
// option 2 preferable to marking the leaf inert. Rejecting at commit was
// declined because it is real Junos syntax and would break importing configs
// that carry it.
