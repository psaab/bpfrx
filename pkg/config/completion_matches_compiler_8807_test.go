// Two leaves the COMPILER reads more of than the SCHEMA declared, so completion
// under-offered while compilation was correct.
//
// This is docs/config-schema.md's rule running BACKWARDS. That rule says adding
// a schema leaf is a compiler-behaviour change, because the packed reader
// resolves its tail through the schema and an undeclared-but-compiled leaf is
// dropped SILENTLY. Here the compiler is AHEAD of the schema instead: it reads
// `then reject <message-type>` from Keys[1] or from a child, and it iterates the
// policy-statement `then` node's children — while the schema declared neither.
// Nothing was dropped, because neither compiler path consults the schema. The
// symptom moved to the other surface: `?` help and tab-completion offered
// nothing, so an operator could not discover a statement that commits fine once
// typed. Two directions, two very different symptoms, one relationship.
//
// BOTH HALVES ARE ASSERTED IN ONE CELL, and that is deliberate. A completion
// guard that only asserts n>0 on the fixed paths is satisfied by a completer
// that matches everything; one that only asserts the control is satisfied by a
// completer that regressed the fix. Either assertion alone is satisfied by a
// stuck answer, so they have to fail together or the guard proves nothing.
//
// AND THE COMPILED RESULT IS PINNED ALONGSIDE. A schema declaration is NOT
// monotone: schema flags feed merge, completion, validation and compilation, so
// "additive to the schema" is not a reason to skip measuring compilation. Every
// spelling below was captured before the declaration and must still deliver the
// same value after it — including the typo rejection, which comes from the
// compiler's UnknownActions and not from the schema, and apply-groups
// inheritance, which is where an earlier schema change caused a live regression.
