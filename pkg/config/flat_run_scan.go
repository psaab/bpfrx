// expandFlatRun returns a container's child statements with a flat-set chain
// expanded into one node per leaf, or the original slice when nothing moves.
//
// THE SHAPE, and it is not what it looks like at two leaves. A flat `set`
// command naming several leaves of one container is ONE command, and SetPath
// models only the FIRST link:
//
//	set security ike gateway gw1 address A external-interface E local-address L
//
//	[gateway gw1]
//	  [address A]
//	    [external-interface E local-address L]     <- ONE node, a FLAT RUN
//
// At TWO leaves the remainder is a single keyword/value pair, so the chain is
// indistinguishable from ordinary nesting and a recursive descent appears to
// work. At THREE it packs onto one node's Keys, and a descent reads
// `external-interface` and silently drops `local-address`. So the expansion
// must be a KEYWORD-DELIMITED SCAN of each node's Keys, not a walk of Children
// — the same scan parseApplicationTerms performs, and the reason #6524's fix
// took that form.
//
// A leaf that is not a node's own first token is re-emitted as a synthesized
// `keyword value` node, so every caller sees the uniform shape it already
// iterates.
//
// GATED ON THE SCHEMA, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A token is only treated as a new
// leaf when the container declares it; anything else stays with the leaf it
// follows, so a multi-token value is not chopped into keywords that happen to
// collide. A leaf that DECLARES CHILDREN keeps its subtree — its body belongs
// to it, and hoisting that would turn a nested block into sibling statements of
// the container.
//
// AND A NESTED NODE IS HOISTED ONLY IF IT NAMES A SIBLING. The first version
// hoisted every child of a terminating leaf, on the reasoning that a leaf
// declaring no children can have no body — so anything under it must be the
// next link of the chain. THAT IS FALSE FOR A `multi` LEAF, and #2419 already
// said so: in the BLOCK spelling `permissions { view; configure; }` the
// children are VALUES, not statements, and hoisting them turned a read leaf
// into an unread one. The shipped spelling-differential gate caught it —
// `system login class <*> permissions` went `inert` in one spelling and
// `drop` in another — where the loser fixture could not, because an
// already-walking container leaving the loser list looks like nothing
// happened. Hoisting only a child that RESOLVES as another leaf of the
// container keeps every chain link (they all begin with a keyword) and leaves
// every value list attached to the leaf that owns it.
//
// A `multi` leaf's own Keys are never cut either: by the #2419 absorb rule a
// sibling token is never absorbed onto them in the first place, so a cut there
// could only ever chop a VALUE that happens to share a sibling's spelling.
//
// THE TWO GUARDS ARE NOT REDUNDANT, THOUGH THE MEASURED DEFECT NEEDED ONLY
// ONE. Mutation matrix against TestSchemaSpellingDifferentialGate, which is
// what caught the regression:
//
//	multi guard  sibling-gated hoist   verdict
//	present      REMOVED               ok
//	REMOVED      present               ok
//	REMOVED      REMOVED               FAIL, A=keep B=inert … F=drop
//
// Either alone clears `permissions`, because that leaf is both multi AND
// block-spelled. They guard DIFFERENT operations and diverge elsewhere: the
// hoist gate also covers a NON-multi `blockValue` leaf, whose children are
// likewise values (#6774's `default-policy { deny-all; }`), and the multi
// guard also covers CUTTING a value list at a token that happens to spell a
// sibling — a case with no instance in today's schema, so it encodes #2419's
// contract rather than a reproduced defect. Recorded rather than trimmed to
// the minimum, because "either one suffices" is a property of the ONE example
// that exists, not of the rule.
//
// WHY EXPAND RATHER THAN REJECT. The chain is a SUPPORTED spelling —
// `set applications application a1 protocol tcp destination-port 80` is tested
// behaviour — and #6524 recorded why teaching the schema to refuse it is wrong:
// a schema-only reject leaves the LENIENT path (boot load, HA SyncApply)
// untouched, which is exactly where already-stored configs are.
