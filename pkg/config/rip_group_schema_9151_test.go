// stayed OPEN-WORLD, so an undeclared trailing statement was accepted and
// silently discarded --

// is open-world AND the leaf it starts at is untyped). Closing the container
// breaks it here.

// arming it is only safe where the subtree is shallow; the ACCEPT rows below are
// what say it did not close more than intended. On #9017 the same flag armed one
// level up began rejecting `from source-prefix-list trusted`, valid shipped
