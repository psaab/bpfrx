// #6706 review r11 F4: bind the NODE-AWARE `LoginDroppedByPacking` assignment.
//
// The flag is assigned at two places in compiler.go: once in the generic
// `compileConfigWithOpts` (CompileConfig / CompileConfigLenient) and once in
// `compileConfigForNodeWithOpts` (CompileConfigForNode /
// CompileConfigForNodeLenient). Every pre-existing true-flag assertion reaches
// the GENERIC one; the node-aware assignment had no test that could fire.
//
// Measured before writing this: reverting ONLY the node-aware line and running
// `./pkg/config/... ./pkg/configstore/... ./pkg/daemon/... ./pkg/cli/...
// ./pkg/osident/... ./cmd/cli/...` came back rc=0, every package `ok`. That is
// the "guard unable to fire" bar.
//
// It is not academic which constructor is covered. `pkg/configstore/store.go`
// uses the node-aware TOLERANT constructor on the load/sync path, so a node
// booting from its own persisted config, or ingesting a peer's, goes through
// line 550 and not line 370. With that line reverted, node 1 tolerantly
// compiles a packed `system login user alice class ops;` to nil Login with the
// flag FALSE, `applyCLILoginClass` takes its legacy early return, and the shell
// runs unrestricted — the exact #6706 fail-open, reopened on the one path an
// HA node actually boots through.
//
// TWO ARMS ARE REQUIRED, and one fixture binds one arm. A single-node fixture
// cannot distinguish "the flag is computed per node" from "the flag is computed
// once and shared": both produce the same answer when only one node is driven.
// The pair below differs in exactly the node id and asserts opposite outcomes,
// so the per-node dimension is what is pinned.

import "testing"

// haLoginNodeSplitConfig puts the packed login stanza in node1's group ONLY.
// node0's group carries an unrelated statement, so the two node views differ in
// exactly the property under test.
