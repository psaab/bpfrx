// #6674 — the two `multi: true` leaves whose extra values are not representable
// are RATIFIED as accepting one value, not implemented as lists.
//
// WHAT #6673 ALREADY DID, so this is not re-litigated: both leaves now
// accumulate every authored value into a plural field, so nothing escapes
// validation, and a multi-valued list is hard-REJECTED at commit / commit-check
// and warned on the tolerant load / peer-sync path. The fail-open half is gone.
// What remained was a TYPE-SHAPE limit and six source sites telling the reader a
// follow-up was coming.
//
// THE TWO ARMS RATIFY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, and conflating them is how a wrong
// decision gets made for the pair:
//
//   - `security nat static rule-set <rs> rule <r> match destination-address`:
//     Junos takes ONE prefix here. A static-NAT rule is a 1:1 mapping — one
//     `match destination-address` against one `then static-nat prefix` — so N
//     external prefixes against one internal prefix names no target. `rule R1` /
//     `rule R2` already expresses the intent. The schema's `multi: true` is an
//     xpf OVER-ADVERTISEMENT of the grammar, not a promise.
//   - `routing-options forwarding-table export`: Junos genuinely takes a policy
//     CHAIN, so "the schema over-advertises" is NOT available as an argument
//     here, and neither is "a chain is equivalent to its first policy" — that
//     equivalence is measured FALSE in
//     pkg/frr/forwarding_export_chain_6674_test.go. It ratifies because
//     resolveECMP derives FRR's GLOBAL `maximum-paths`, which has no per-route
//     form, while Junos evaluates the chain per route and stops at the first
//     terminating action. The cheap composition is not Junos and the faithful
//     one is not expressible.
//
// This file pins the OPERATOR-FACING half of that decision. A source comment
// that rots is bad; a warning message that promises a feature which is never
// coming is worse, because the operator acts on it — they leave the list in
// place and wait.

// warningsFor6674 compiles a config on the TOLERANT path (load / peer-sync) and
// returns the warnings, which is where the operator-facing text for these two
// gates lives. The strict path returns the same text as an error.
