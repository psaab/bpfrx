// TestValueExamplesParseAsWritten8924 asserts that every `valueExamples` entry
// in setSchema PARSES as written in a `set` command value position.
//
// A valueExample is not documentation — it is the value the tool OFFERS the
// operator at `?` completion. An example the parser then rejects makes the tool
// contradict itself, and the operator's evidence is a completion suggesting a
// value and the parser refusing it. The natural conclusion is that the feature
// is broken, not that the value needs quoting (#8924).
//
// That is what happened to the OpenSSH algorithm names. `ValidateSSHAlgorithm`
// is built to accept `@`-bearing names and the schema offered
// `aes256-gcm@openssh.com` as an example, but the lexer rejects a bare `@`, so
// the `@` branch of the validator's own regex was unreachable for any unquoted
// input. The examples are now quoted, which parses and compiles to the
// unquoted name (asserted below).
//
// CENSUS, not a spot-check: this walks the whole schema. When the defect was
// found, exactly 3 examples repo-wide failed — the two `ciphers` and one of the
// `macs`. Guarding the invariant rather than the three sites is what stops the
// fourth from being written.
