// #6190: a KEY-ONLY account's xpf-written authorized_keys survived a factory
// reset. The factory-reset login teardown (zeroizeLoginAccounts) removes
// authorized_keys only for accounts in the provisioned-users REGISTRY. But a
// pre-existing (operator / prior-tenant) account configured with `system login
// user <name> authentication ssh-*` and NO encrypted-password gets a
// provisioned-keys marker and NO registry marker (applySystemLogin writes
// markProvisioned only in the useradd branch; reconcileUserPassword only on a
// password apply). Such a KEY-ONLY account is never iterated by the registry
// loop, so before #6190 the #6183 fix correctly swept its keys MARKER but the
// actual xpf-written authorized_keys FILE was never removed — the prior tenant
// retained SSH login on that account after a "factory reset" (the #4598
// credential-leak class). This is ASYMMETRIC with the day-2 path
// (reconcileAbsentLoginUsers enumerates the UNION provisionedNames() and
// deprovisionLoginUser DOES remove that key file).
//
// The fix (zeroizeSweepProvisionedKeys) removes the xpf-written key FILE for
// every account with a provisioned-keys marker (union enumeration), UID-gated
// and fail-closed, while preserving the retained-set (#6183) semantics and never
// touching an operator's own (unmarked) key file.

// TestZeroizeRemovesKeyOnlyAccountAuthorizedKeys pins the #6190 fix: a live
// key-only account (provisioned-keys marker + xpf-written authorized_keys, NO
// registry/password marker) has BOTH its marker AND its authorized_keys removed
// by the factory-reset teardown, while a NON-provisioned operator account's own
// key file (no marker) is left untouched. No userdel fires — xpf only added a
// key, it did not create the account.
//
// RED on revert (two equivalent neutralizations, both clean assertion failures,
// neither a compile break):
//
//   - Surgical (target count 1): comment out the single
//     `fail(os.Remove(keysFile))` in zeroizeSweepProvisionedKeys' `default`
//     (UID-match) branch — the exact key-file removal this account exercises.
//     `keysFile` stays used by the genuinely-absent branch, so it still compiles;
//     the keyonly marker is still swept, but the xpf-written authorized_keys FILE
//     SURVIVES, so `assertAbsent(keyonlyKeys)` here goes RED. Exactly this test
//     fails — target count 1.
//   - Broad (target count 2): revert the phase-(C) keys-root sweep call in
//     zeroizeLoginAccounts from `zeroizeSweepProvisionedKeys(...)` back to
//     `zeroizeSweepResourceMarkerRoot(zeroizeProvisionedKeysDir(), retained,
//     fail)` (the marker-only sweep). That also drops the UID-gated fail-closed
//     retention, so BOTH this test (key file survives) AND
//     TestZeroizeKeyOnlyRetainedAndMismatchPreserveKeys (the UID-mismatch marker
//     is erased instead of retained) go RED — target count 2.
//
// No other test seeds a key-only account and asserts its key-file removal.

//     has a registry marker whose recorded UID (3000) mismatches its live UID
//     (3001), so the registry teardown reports the anomaly and retains its
//     markers; the keys sweep must then skip it entirely.
//   - UID-mismatch operator-key protection: `stalekey` is a KEY-ONLY account
//     whose keys marker (2000) mismatches its live UID (2001) — an out-of-band
//     userdel+recreate. Its current authorized_keys belongs to SOMEONE ELSE, so
//     the sweep must leave the file AND retain the marker rather than delete an
//     operator's keys.
//
// zeroizeLoginAccounts returns a non-nil error (both are surfaced fail-closed
// conditions), which is the expected outcome — the point of this test is the
