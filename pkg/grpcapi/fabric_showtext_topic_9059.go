// #9059: ShowText is on the fabric allowlist as a METHOD, and it multiplexes
// ~127 topics behind that one method — so allowlisting it admits all of them.
//
// THE FILE ALREADY MAKES THIS ARGUMENT, four lines above, about a sibling:
//
//	SystemAction is deliberately absent: it multiplexes fabric-safe cross-node
//	cluster-failover with destructive node actions (zeroize/reboot/halt/
//	power-off) under ONE gRPC method, so a method-name allowlist that included
//	it would still expose zeroize. It is gated separately, by request-action,
//	in isFabricSafeSystemAction.
//
// Identical shape, identical remedy. ShowText sits in the same map with no
// equivalent per-topic gate, and fabricAllowlistUnaryInterceptor applied none.
//
// AND THE PRICING TABLE ALREADY EXISTS — on the other chain. authz_methods.go
// prices `test-policy:` / `test-routing:` / `test-zone:` at PermControl, calling
// them "policy reconnaissance … exactly the tier confusion this file exists to
// prevent", and TestEveryShowTextTopicHasAPermission_5278 keeps it exhaustive.
// It runs on the LOOPBACK principal chain only; the fabric listener shares no
// interceptor with it, which is itself pinned by
// TestFabricListenerDoesNotInstallThePrincipalGate_5278.
//
// WHY AN EXPLICIT TOPIC ALLOWLIST RATHER THAN REUSING THAT TABLE. The table
// prices a topic for a PRINCIPAL — it answers "may this login class read this".
// The fabric listener has no principal; its question is different and narrower:
// "does this node ever ASK a peer for this". Reusing a permission tier here
// would admit every topic priced at or below whatever tier the fabric was
// deemed to hold, which is the method-granularity mistake again, one level down.
//
// The allowlist's own comment says each entry is "a method the local node
// actually proxies". That is true at method granularity and false at topic
// granularity, and this restores it: both peer-proxy call sites send exactly
// one topic — server_show_forwarding.go and pkg/cli/cli_show_chassis.go both
// send "chassis-forwarding".
//
// What this actually withholds is RUNTIME state, and the honest framing matters
// for anyone weighing the change: the peer already receives the entire active
// config TEXT through config sync, so configuration is not the marginal
// disclosure. `route-all`, `security-log`, `commit-history`, the `nat-*-detail`
// topics and the `test-policy:` policy simulator are.
var fabricAllowedShowTextTopics = map[string]bool{
	// The only topic either peer-proxy call site sends
	// (server_show_forwarding.go:123, pkg/cli/cli_show_chassis.go:153).
	"chassis-forwarding": true,
}

// isFabricSafeShowText reports whether a ShowText request asks for a topic the
// local node actually proxies to a peer.
//
// A non-ShowText request returns false and is refused: this is only consulted
// once the method is known to be ShowText, and a request that fails to type-assert
// there is malformed rather than permitted. Fail closed, like its sibling.
