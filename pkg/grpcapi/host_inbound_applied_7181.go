// #7181: the zone projections render DESIRED host-inbound config. This carries
// the APPLIED state — whether a kernel table is actually enforcing it — so a
// cold-boot failure can no longer be reported as a configured default-deny in
// force (codex-review-182:4394).

// The arm ORDER is load-bearing. `Established` is STICKY-TRUE — a failed render
// does not clear it, because the retained generation may still be protecting —
// so testing it first and returning "current" would report a box whose latest
// render failed as healthy. That conflation is the entire defect #7181 exists
// to remove, and re-introducing it at the rendering layer would leave the data
// correct and the operator misled.
