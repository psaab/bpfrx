// Codex PR #6743 r7-F3, RE-KEYED in r4-F1: the buffer renders must take
// exactly ONE load of the #2114 cell.
//
// Before r7 they took three — dataplane.Published(s.dp) (a predicate that
// no longer exists; it was `Unwrap(p) != nil` and was deleted in r2-B6),
// then s.dpProbe(), then s.dp.GetMapStats() — each an independent load. A
// setDataplane(nil) landing between them re-created the exact confusion
// that check existed to prevent: the publication check passed against a
// live backend, the later loads resolved nil, and the render printed "No
// BPF maps available" — a statement about a LOADED backend's maps — for a
// daemon that no longer had a backend at all.
//
// WHY THIS GUARD WAS RE-KEYED. The r7 version counted Unwrap CALLS and
// asserted the count was 1. That is a proxy: the property is how many
// times the render loads the cell, and not every load is an Unwrap. The
// old oneShotIndirection embedded *dataplane.Manager and declared only
// Unwrap, so `s.dp.SessionCount()` — which under the real liveDataPlane
// calls resolve(), an independent load — was served by the embedded
// Manager and never touched the counter. The guard therefore stayed green
// across a residual second load that lived in the very arm its own fixture
// drove (mapStatsBackend has no Status(), so the map-stats arm is the one
// exercised). Measured at 6163445e9: reverting BOTH userspace-arm
// conversions left ./pkg/grpcapi/... ./pkg/cli/... ./pkg/api/...
// ./pkg/dataplane/... AND ./pkg/daemon/... at rc=0 — a complete survivor.
//
// The fixture below is keyed on the property instead. Its reach is TOTAL
// over grpcRuntime's method set, and that is a property of how it is built
// rather than of how many methods it happens to declare:
//
//   - the three methods declared below (Unwrap, SessionCount, GetMapStats)
//     each perform their OWN counted cell load, exactly as liveDataPlane
//     does — Unwrap reads d.dataplane(); resolve() reads it again;
//   - EVERY OTHER method PANICS, because the embedded grpcRuntime is a nil
//     interface. Method promotion dispatches every undeclared method
//     through that one field, so none of them can quietly answer.
//
// There is therefore no method on this value that reaches the backend
// without the counter seeing it. That is the r4 correction: r4 embedded a
// concrete *dataplane.Manager, which SERVED all the rest — closing 2 of 25
// while the header claimed all of them. Measured at 44603f888: inserting
// `if !s.dp.IsLoaded() { buf.WriteString("stale\n") }` into showBuffers'
// map-stats arm — a real second cell load — left loads=1, all four
// subtests PASS, pkg/grpcapi rc=0.
//
// The undeclared-method count is NOT written down here, deliberately. Two
// rounds carried a hand-typed "22" against a 25-method interface with 2
// methods shadowed, which is 23 — a quantifier re-typed over a population
// nobody had counted, in a header whose whole subject is quantifiers.
// TestShowBuffersCountingIndirectionServesNothingSilently now derives both
// the population and the partition from the interface TYPE by reflection,
// so the claim is checked at every run instead of restated in prose.
//
// A render that takes a second load through a DECLARED method both bumps
// the counter AND observably tears, because the cell is empty from load 2
// onward. That is deterministic, not a race: a cell that holds a backend
// at load 1 and nothing afterwards is the observable consequence of a
// concurrent setDataplane(nil) with the timing removed.

const (
	// The published backend's session counts. Non-zero on BOTH families so
	// the render's `if v4 > 0 || v6 > 0` gate opens: a second load resolves
	// nil, yields (0,0), and the "Active sessions" line vanishes. A zero
	// count here would suppress the line either way and make the output
	// assertion vacuous — which is what the r7 fixture did.
	singleLoadV4 = 7
	singleLoadV6 = 3
)

// singleLoadActiveSessions is the operator-visible consequence of taking
// exactly one load. Under two loads this line is silently absent.
const singleLoadActiveSessions = "Active sessions: 7 IPv4, 3 IPv6, 10 total"

// countingIndirection is a live indirection modelled on pkg/daemon's
// liveDataPlane: a backend-reaching method performs its OWN cell load, and
// the cell is empty from the second load onward.
//
// The embedded grpcRuntime is a nil INTERFACE, never a concrete value. It
// is what makes this value assignable to Server.dp — the promoted method
// set is grpcRuntime's, so *countingIndirection satisfies the field — and
// it is simultaneously what makes the counter's reach total: the three
// methods below shadow their promoted counterparts, and every OTHER
// promoted method dispatches through a nil interface and panics at the
// production call site that took it.
//
// Do NOT restore the r4 `*dataplane.Manager` embed, and do not populate
// this field at a construction site either — r6 measured that spelling as
// the live escape. A non-nil embed satisfies the same field while SERVING
// every undeclared method, so a render that reached the backend through
// any of them took a cell load this fixture could not see, and the counter
// stayed at 1. A loud panic naming the production line is the intended
// answer; a silent zero is the bug. load() refuses a populated embed and
// TestShowBuffersCountingIndirectionServesNothingSilently proves that
// refusal fires.

//     the r4 second-load defect verbatim with every guard green and
//     pkg/grpcapi at rc=0.
//   - The invariant now lives in load(), the choke point every counted
//     method goes through, so it holds for every instance a render
