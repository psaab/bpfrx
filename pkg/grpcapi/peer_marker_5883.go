// #5883: the two internal hop-control metadata keys.
//
// `x-peer-forwarded` marks a request one node already forwarded to its cluster
// peer; `xpf-no-peer` is the same idea on the show/monitor proxies. Both exist
// to bound forwarding to ONE hop, and every handler that reads one uses it to
// SUPPRESS work: skip the peer clear, skip the peer fan-out, serve locally
// instead of proxying.
//
// They were read straight off incoming metadata by presence
// (`len(md.Get(...)) > 0`), which makes them caller-settable. Any client that
// can reach a listener could assert "I am a forwarded peer request" and have
// the node skip the peer half of a cluster-wide operation while still returning
// a normal success — a clear that says it cleared the cluster and did not.
//
// The fix is not to authenticate the header. It is to stop the header from
// being the carrier at all: trust is a property of WHICH LISTENER the call
// arrived on, and a listener decides it, not the caller.
//
//   - The FABRIC listener is the only one a cluster peer dials. Its interceptor
//     chain runs #4107 auth first, and only then promotes the header into an
//     in-process context value. A caller cannot set a context value.
//   - The LOOPBACK listener is never dialed by a peer, so an inbound marker
//     there is by definition forged (or confused). It is stripped, and nothing
//     is promoted.
//
// Both listeners STRIP the keys after the interceptor runs, so no handler can
// reach past the capability to the raw metadata even by mistake — the header
// does not exist below this layer.
//
// Deliberately NOT changed: the marker still rides an ordinary metadata header
// on the wire between nodes. It has to — that is the only channel there is. The
// change is that a header is now evidence only when the listener that received
// it is one a peer could have dialed.
