// errDDNSNoBackendToWithdraw is returned by deleteOwnedLocked when an owned
// record must be withdrawn but only the no-op backend is wired (#2699). The
// wire RR was NOT removed and ownership is DELIBERATELY KEPT (so the record
// stays cleanable once a real backend is reconfigured), so the delete is
// reported as a failure rather than a silent ownership drop. reconcileOnceLocked
// treats it like any other delete error (the record is left in the store, its
// identity/address/FQDN are blocked from re-add this cycle, and a later
// reconcile retries) — but it is NOT a wire-level error, so it does not fail
// the whole reconcile pass: a turn-off / restart with no backend resolves to
// nop legitimately, and wedging the pass on it would be noise. The next
// reconcile that resolves a live backend (or the next-cycle withdraw guard
// supplying the prior live updater) performs the real withdraw.

// SHIPPED in #2691 P1b (this phase):
//   - ScopeKey on ownership records + per-family INDEPENDENT v4/v6 policy
//     (#2663): ReconcileScoped resolves a policy + backend PER FAMILY;
//   - per-RG HA writer gate (#2664): a ScopeGate/ScopeResolver gates the
//     publish decision PER redundancy-group (stop-writing-never-withdraw on a
//     partial demotion), wired from pkg/daemon (ddnsReconcileOptions);
//   - source / interface / VRF binding for the RFC 2136 update socket (#2665,
//     backend_bind.go).
//
// STILL DEFERRED:
