// #6755: WireRRClaim carried no authority, so two ownership surfaces publishing
// an equal (FQDN, type, rdata) to DIFFERENT DNS servers compared EQUAL. What
// that equality decides is whether to SUPPRESS a DELETE — so a teardown skipped
// its own delete believing the other surface co-owned the record, and the record
// stayed published at its own authority forever.
//
// The two directions must BOTH be pinned. Without the same-authority positive,
// "include the authority" and "never suppress" are indistinguishable, and the
// second silently reverts #5748's cross-surface clobber protection — turning a
// stale-record bug into a data-loss one.
