// #6754: the HTTP DDNS client cache keys on the RAW binding leaves, but the
// device a client is actually bound to is RESOLVED — bindDevice comes from
// config.ResolveKernelIfName, whose output is a function of the whole committed
// config (reth→physical member, the tunnel name map, the IRB→bridge map,
// SecureTunnelUnitNetdev, unit-vs-vlan-id).
//
// So the resolved device can change while all three key leaves stay
// byte-identical: move reth0's active member and `destination-interface
// reth0.50` keeps its key, keeps its cached client, and silently keeps
// SO_BINDTODEVICE on the OLD physical device. Nothing errors — the publish just
// egresses from the wrong interface.
//
// The cache key is deliberately NOT changed to the resolved value: the #2956
// reap keys on the binding leaves, and re-keying would decouple the two. The
// fix validates the resolution on a HIT instead, which is the check the raw key
// structurally cannot make.

// resolverReturning6754 is a committed-config interface resolver whose answer
// the test can change between calls, standing in for a commit that moves a
// reth's active member without touching any DDNS binding leaf.
