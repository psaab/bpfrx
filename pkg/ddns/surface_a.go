// surface_a.go: the Surface A router/interface-address DDNS engine (#2691 P2,
// plan §2.1, §5.3, §5.5). Surface A publishes the firewall's OWN address — an
// interface/unit/family's learned WAN address (DHCP lease, static, netlink) —
// as a single A/AAAA record at a configured FQDN through an external DNS
// provider. It is the classic "dyndns client on the CPE" surface.
//
// REUSE, DO NOT FORK THE SPINE: Surface A drives the SAME Backend (DNSUpdater)
// interface, the SAME record construction (buildHostRecord → LeaseDNSRecord),
// the SAME RFC 2136 backend (newRFC2136Updater, with self-ownership semantics:
// no DHCID/ClientID, so sendAddOwned uses the name-not-in-use / refresh-owned
// prerequisite), the SAME ScopeKey ownership primitive (plan §5.4), and the
// SAME durable-fsync state store pattern (state.go ddnsState shape) — only the
// state FILE differs (interface-ddns-state.json, plan §5.5). The ONLY thing
// Surface A adds on top of the spine is the update ENGINE discipline the
// DHCP-lease reconciler does not need: per-scope change detection, a
// forced-refresh wire floor decoupled from the poll cadence, and flat error
// backoff (ban-avoidance) — the inadyn ideas #4/#7/#8 (plan §3.3/§5.5).
//
// HA (plan §5.6 / #2664): a router record on a reth/virtual interface is
// published only by the node that masters its scope's RG. The SurfaceAManager
// takes the SAME per-scope ScopeGate the lease reconciler does; a gated-out
// scope is stop-writing, never-withdraw (the peer RG master refreshes; a
// withdraw race would blackhole). A standalone (nil gate) always publishes.

// defaultSurfaceAStatePath is the on-disk location of the Surface A
// last-published / ownership store (plan §5.5). Distinct from the Surface B

// collide on a record key and either can be reset independently.
