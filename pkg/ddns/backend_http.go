// backend_http.go: shared discipline for the HTTP-API DDNS backends (#2691 P3,
// plan §5.2/§8.1/§8.3). The dyndns2, Cloudflare, Route 53, and generic-templated
// backends all implement the SAME DNSUpdater interface the RFC 2136 backend does
// (UpsertLease / DeleteLease over a LeaseDNSRecord) so the Surface A engine
// drives them identically — change-detection, forced-refresh, per-RG HA gate,
// and flat error backoff all apply unchanged. Only the wire mechanism differs.
//
// Security / ban-avoidance discipline shared here (plan §8.1/§8.3):
//   - HTTPS with the system trust store; certificate + hostname verification
//     stays ON (no InsecureSkipVerify) — the inadyn secure-ssl default-on posture.
//   - bounded request timeout (no infinite hang) so a stuck provider can never
//     wedge the reconcile loop.
//   - the response body is read with an io.LimitReader cap so a hostile/buggy
//     provider cannot OOM the daemon.
//   - credentials come from config.Secret (Reveal() only at the transport
//     boundary); no secret is ever placed in an error string or a log line.

// httpClientTimeout bounds a single provider request. The Surface A engine's own
// per-pass timeout is 60s (daemon surfaceAReconcileTimeout); a per-request floor
// well under that lets a slow provider fail one scope without starving the pass.
const httpClientTimeout = 15 * time.Second

// replies are a few bytes ("good 203.0.113.5\n"); Cloudflare/Route53 JSON/XML

// ROUND 8 REPLACED A SENTINEL WITH A TYPE, because the sentinel was FORGEABLE.
// The previous form asked errors.Is(err, errRedirectRefused) and, on a match,
// returned err.Error() verbatim. errors.Is dispatches to the error's OWN
// `Is(error) bool` method, and CheckIP takes a caller-supplied *http.Client —
// so a RoundTripper returning an error whose Is always says true and whose
// Error() is the request URL got the credential printed unchanged. Identity is
// not something a caller-supplied value can be asked about; errors.As has the
// same hole (it dispatches to `As(any) bool`).
//
// A concrete UNEXPORTED struct type cannot be forged: no other package can name
// it, so no other package can construct a value of it, and a type assertion is
// a language operation with no user-defined hook. scrubInnerError therefore
// walks the chain itself and type-ASSERTS rather than asking errors.Is/As.
//
// The fields hold the *url.URL values, not pre-rendered text, so the host and
// scheme grammar is applied HERE at render time — unconditionally, on the way
// out — rather than trusted to have been applied at construction. What that
// buys is a bounded CHARACTER SET on a provider-supplied host: a zone id, raw
// non-ASCII, or anything that is not a plain reg-name is withheld.
//
// The grammar does NOT bound the CONTENT, only the character set — and that is
// why the refused TARGET is no longer rendered at all. A provider answering
// `Location: https://<our-own-password>.evil.example/` gets the hop refused,
// but `<password>.evil.example` is a well-formed reg-name, so naming it printed
// the credential into the daemon log. The general-case justification in
// scrubURLError — that such a name is already in every resolver query and TLS
// ClientHello — is FALSE here: CheckRedirect aborts before any dial, so a
// refused target is never resolved and never sent anywhere.
//
// It also broke deduplication, which is what forced the fix rather than another
// paragraph of disclosure. The daemon keys a never-pruned, process-lifetime
// sync.Map on the rendered string to warn once per (provider, error); a
// provider redirecting to per-request hostnames therefore minted a fresh key
// and a fresh WARN every 30s reconcile tick, forever. Exactly the unbounded
// growth the body-read scrub was added to stop, on the OTHER of doRequest's two
// adjacent error returns.
//
// So Error() now names only the FROM host (our configured endpoint, stable) and
// describes the target by class. scrubURLErrorAt additionally suppresses its own
// target render when the chain carries a refusal, because net/http sets
// url.Error.URL to the provider's Location — without that, the same
// provider-chosen value came out twice.

// guardRedirect is the shared *http.Client.CheckRedirect for every HTTP DDNS

//
//  1. NO SCHEME DOWNGRADE (#4861). A credentialed backend (dyndns2 Basic auth,
//     DuckDNS/Cloudflare query/bearer token, Route 53 SigV4) that started over
//     TLS must never be walked onto a plaintext connection, which would put the
//     update credential on the wire for an on-path attacker. An HTTP->HTTPS
//     upgrade is still followed.
//
//  2. NO CROSS-HOST REDIRECT (#6545). The scheme guard alone left an
//     https->https hop to a DIFFERENT host wide open, and Go discloses real
//     secrets across exactly that hop — verified firsthand against the stdlib,
//     not assumed:
//
//     - Referer carries the FULL previous URL INCLUDING the query string.
//     net/http refererForURL() strips only the userinfo and suppresses the
//     header only for https->http; on an https->https hop to any host the
//     redirect target receives e.g.
//     "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=h&token=<TOKEN>". That is a
//     live provider credential for DuckDNS (token is a QUERY param, not
//     Basic — see backend_duckdns.go), for the generic backend (a %p-expanded
//     password or a literal ?token= in url-template), and for a checkip-url
//     that carries an API key. It also discloses the FQDN and the public
//     address being published for every backend.
//
//     - Go forwards Authorization/Cookie to any SUBDOMAIN of the original
//     host (net/http shouldCopyHeaderOnRedirect -> isDomainOrSubdomain).
//     So a redirect to sub.<configured-host> hands the dyndns2/generic Basic
//     credential and the Cloudflare bearer token to a host the operator never
//     configured. Stripping Referer would NOT have closed that half.
//
//     Refusing outright, rather than sanitizing and following, is the choice
//     because these clients are machine-to-machine callers of an endpoint the
//     operator PINNED (a built-in provider constant, or a `server` /
//     `url-template` / `checkip-url` leaf). There is no discovery step that
//     needs to land somewhere else, and following a Location to an unconfigured
//     host is itself the trust violation: it sends the update payload (which
//     FQDN, which public address) — and on a 307/308 the whole request body,
//     e.g. a Route 53 change batch — to a host the operator never named. The
//     realistic trigger is a mistyped or hostile `server` leaf, and fail-closed
//     is this package's posture everywhere else (bind error, malformed
//     checkip-url, unrecognized response body). A provider that genuinely moves
//     to a new host is served by pointing the leaf at the final host; the error
//     names the CONFIGURED endpoint and the refusal class so the operator can do
//     exactly that. It deliberately does NOT name the refused target: that value
//     is provider-chosen, so rendering it both disclosed a credential-shaped
//     reg-name and varied per request, defeating the daemon's once-per-
//     (provider, error) dedup. SAME-host
//     redirects — the common real case, a path or API-version move — are still
//     followed.
//
//  3. NO Referer ON ANY FOLLOWED REDIRECT. Defense in depth on top of (2): the
//     hop we do allow is same-host, so the target already holds the credential
//     it is being sent, but there is no reason for a DDNS API call to echo its
//     own query string back into a header that provider access logs record
//     separately. Go sets Referer on the new request BEFORE calling
//     CheckRedirect precisely so a policy can override it (see the comment on
//     Client.do), so deleting it here is the supported seam. Deleting from a nil
//     header map is a defined no-op, so a synthetic request needs no guard.
//
// Host comparison is by HOSTNAME only — case-insensitive per RFC 4343, with one
// trailing root dot normalized away, and deliberately PORT-INDEPENDENT. The
// trust anchor is the DNS name and the TLS certificate identity bound to it,
// which is what the operator configured and what cert verification pins; a port
// move stays inside that identity, and a port-strict rule would falsely refuse
// the plain "https://prov.example:443/x" -> "https://prov.example/x" default-port
// normalization. A Unicode (non-punycode) Location host compares unequal to its
// A-label spelling and is refused; that is the conservative direction (a false
// refusal, never a false allow) and no in-tree provider uses an IDN host.
//
// The comparison is against the PREVIOUS hop, matching the scheme guard. Under
// exact equality that is equivalent to comparing against the original request:
// every hop must equal its predecessor, so by induction every hop equals hop 0.

// render in resolveDyndns2Endpoint, tracked separately as #6606 and pinned by
// an explicit, self-expiring exemption in the source gate
// (url_render_class_6545_test.go).
//
// WHAT IT RENDERS: at most SCHEME://HOST[:PORT], built by ALLOWLIST — and the
// allowlist is over the CHARACTERS, not just over the url.URL fields. Round 7
// found that field-level allowlisting was not enough: an allowlist is only as
// good as the safety of what it admits, and `Host` is NOT credential-free.
//
// Field-level allowlisting (a fresh url.URL carrying only Scheme and Host)
// closed the field-expansion class — User, Path, RawPath, RawQuery, Fragment,
// RawFragment, Opaque, OmitHost and anything net/url adds later are absent by
// construction. It did not close the credential class, because `Host` is a
// container for substituted template text, not a name. What url.Parse will
// legally leave in `Host` (verified against Go 1.26 net/url):
//
//   - AN IPv6 ZONE ID. RFC 6874 lets a zone use "basically any %-encoding it
//     likes", and net/url honours that: "https://[fe80::1%25%p]/update" is a
//     SUPPORTED generic template and parses to Host = "[fe80::1%<password>]".
//     u.Hostname() does not help — it strips the brackets and keeps the zone.
//   - A REG-NAME LABEL. "https://%p.example.com/" parses to
//     Host = "<password>.example.com" whenever the password is host-safe.
//   - RAW NON-ASCII BYTES. %-escapes above 0x7F are decoded in place, so
//     "ex%FFample.com" reaches Host as a literal 0xFF — log-injection material
//     on top of everything else.
//   - A PORT, which is digits-only (net/url's validOptionalPort) but is still
//     a place a numeric password can land.
//   - ANY OF THE ABOVE FROM THE PROVIDER. A cross-host Location echoing our own
//     credential as its hostname is refused by guardRedirect — correctly — and
//     the refusal named the host.
//
// Userinfo is NOT in this list: url.Parse splits "user:pass@host" into u.User,
// so an ordinary credentialed URL was already safe.
//
// So the host is rebuilt from a CLOSED GRAMMAR rather than copied (safeHostText):
// an IP literal is re-rendered from netip with its ZONE DROPPED, and a reg-name
// must be ASCII letters/digits/'-'/'_' in dot-separated labels or it is withheld
// entirely. The scheme is likewise reduced to the two values this package ever
// legitimately uses. What survives is exactly the network identity that is on
// the wire in the DNS query, the TCP SYN and the TLS SNI regardless; path,
// query, userinfo, fragment and zone id are all operator- or provider-supplied
// opaque bytes and are treated as secret.
//
// THE RESIDUAL, stated rather than papered over. Two things survive:
//
//   - a password used as the DNS NAME ("https://%p.example.com/"). It is
//     already in every resolver query, in the PTR/SNI the endpoint sees, and in
//     the TLS ClientHello; the renderer cannot tell a legitimate label from a
//     password without template-expansion taint, and withholding every hostname
//     would gut diagnosis.
//   - a NUMERIC password used as a valid port ("https://prov.example:%p/"),
//     which is retained as up to five decimal digits.
//
// Both are configuration errors the logging boundary cannot repair, and hiding
// them would make them less likely to be noticed. But note the asymmetry
// honestly: a log is durable and often more widely readable than a packet
// capture, so "disclosed elsewhere" is a reason to accept these two, not a
// general licence to log secrets.
//
// The diagnostic cost of dropping the path is deliberate and small: the
// caller's own prefix already names the backend and the operation ("ddns
// cloudflare: build request", "ddns route53: build list request"), so what is
// lost is the API sub-path, not the ability to tell which call failed.
//
// A URL THAT DOES NOT RE-PARSE yields NO URL at all — only the sanitized
// urlParseCause reason. The old code fell back to ue.URL VERBATIM, which was
// survivable only while this helper was reachable exclusively from the
// transport path, where the URL had necessarily parsed on the way in. It is now
// also the renderer for BUILD-request failures, whose DEFINING input is a URL
// that does not parse, so that fallback would have been a direct leak of the
// whole raw string.
//
// THE INNER ERROR is rendered too, because that is the entire diagnostic value
// ("connection refused", "i/o timeout", "certificate signed by unknown
// authority") — but by CLASSIFICATION, never verbatim. See scrubInnerError.
//
// A non-*url.Error goes through the same classifier: it is not automatically
// URL-free just because it is not a *url.Error (round 7).
// errTreeWithinBound reports whether err's Unwrap tree is small enough that the
// STDLIB can walk it safely. Round 11 bounded this file's own recursion and
// stopped there, which was not enough: errors.Is and errors.As do their own
// traversal, dispatching to the error's Unwrap method, and that method belongs
// to the caller. An error whose Unwrap returns ITSELF makes errors.As spin
// forever, and an Unwrap() []error self-cycle recurses until the stack
// overflows -- a `fatal error` that recover() cannot catch.
//
// The round-11 cyclic test missed both because its root was directly a
// *url.Error, so errors.As matched on the first node and never followed Unwrap
// at all. The guard has to run BEFORE the first errors.As, not inside the
// recursion it protects.
//
// A NODE BUDGET, not a visited set: errors are interfaces, and comparing two
// for identity panics when the dynamic type is not comparable. A budget is
// sufficient anyway -- a cycle exhausts it, and so does a nest deep enough to
// overflow. Recursion here is self-limiting because every call spends budget.
//
// #6635 MOVED THE CALL SITES. Round 11's guard ran once, at the two PUBLIC
// entry points, and validated the tree AS PRESENTED THERE. That is not the tree
// the stdlib ends up walking, because errors.As dispatches to an As(any) bool
// method the caller defines, and that method hands back a value of the caller's
// choosing:
//
//	func (e hostile) As(target any) bool {
//	    *target.(**url.Error) = &url.Error{Err: selfUnwrappingError{}}
//	    return true
//	}
//
// The tree at entry is a single node, so the guard passes; the SUBTREE the As
// installs was never walked, and scrubURLErrorAt descends straight into it and
// spins forever inside the next errors.As. Reproduced before the fix: the entry
// guard returned true and the scrubber did not return.
//
// So the guard now runs at every entry to the depth-carrying functions, which
// is where a caller-supplied subtree can first appear. The cost is a re-walk
// per level -- at most maxUnwrapDepth^2 Unwrap calls, on an error path that
// runs at most once per reconcile tick, and only for trees that are already
// pathological. A legitimate error walks one or two levels.
//
// WHAT IS STILL NOT BOUNDED, stated rather than implied. A caller-supplied
// Error() or Unwrap() that BLOCKS or never returns hangs the first render or
// the guard itself, and no placement of this function fixes that. Bounding it
// would need a watchdog goroutine per render. That is deliberately not done,
// and the reason is not only cost: a blocking Error() hangs ANY fmt render of
// that error anywhere in the daemon, so bounding it inside one package's
// scrubber buys nothing while adding a goroutine to a path that must stay
// cheap. Neither is reachable in production -- errors on these paths come from
// net/http and the stdlib, and a provider can choose BYTES but not a Go type.

// caller-supplied Error() text reaches the output on any path.

// Error() is built from fixed prose plus refusalHost/refusalScheme output. That

// The scrubbers above bound error VALUES that carry a request URL. This is the

// backends render into a returned error the daemon logs — Cloudflare's
// Errors[].Message, Route 53's decoded Code/Message, and the unrecognized first
// response line on dyndns2 and DuckDNS.
//
// THE PROVIDER IS THE UNTRUSTED PARTY HERE. No hostile transport is needed: a
// "your request was invalid: <the request>" style API echoes our own update URL
// back, and a DuckDNS-shaped endpoint carries its token in the QUERY, so the
// echo is the credential. The same body is also the DoS surface — readCappedBody
// admits httpMaxResponseBody (64 KiB), and every byte of it was reaching a
// journal line on every reconcile tick of a persistent failure, plus the
// provider's retained lastErr.
//
// WHAT THE SINKS ALREADY DO, so this does not duplicate them. Control-character
// forgery is closed twice over and neither fix belongs here: the daemon's
// slog.TextHandler (cmd/xpfd/main.go) strconv.Quote-s any value carrying a byte
// outside printable ASCII, so an embedded newline cannot split a journal line;
// and `show services ddns` renders LastError through termsafe.SanitizeForDisplay
// on both the CLI and gRPC surfaces (#6468). What NO sink can undo is a
// credential in the bytes, or 64 KiB of them.
//
// SO THIS BOUNDS TWO THINGS AND IS HONEST ABOUT THE THIRD:
//
//  1. LENGTH — hard cap, total. This half is a proof: nothing provider-chosen
//     can exceed maxProviderTextBytes plus a fixed marker.
//  2. URL AND USERINFO SHAPES — a whitespace-delimited token carrying "://", a
//     userinfo-shaped "user:pass@host", or a percent-escape is replaced whole.
//     This closes the ECHO threat the issue describes, where the secret arrives
//     inside a well-formed URL.
//  3. NOT a proof against a provider that WANTS to leak. A credential echoed as
//     bare prose ("your token abc123 is invalid") is indistinguishable from a
//     word, and no filter recovers it. That residual is accepted rather than
//     papered over, because the alternative — withholding provider text
//     wholesale, as the transport path does for its own errors — costs the
//     operator the single most useful diagnostic they get ("token invalid",
//     "zone not found", "rate limited") in exchange for a threat model
//     (a provider deliberately exfiltrating a credential it was ALREADY GIVEN)
//     that withholding does not actually close either.
//
// WHY NOT THE CODE-MAPPING OPTION. Mapping known provider error codes onto our
// own constants, the transportReason discipline, would give a closed output —
// but only for codes we already know. The unmapped case is exactly the case an
// operator is debugging, and it would render as a constant saying nothing. Route
// 53 also classifies delete-idempotency on the raw message text
// (r53DeleteAlreadyGone), so the VALUE must keep flowing to the classifier
// untouched; only the RENDER goes through here.
//

// its prefix — "https://user:PA" — rendered, which is a partial credential.
