// checkip_url_redaction_6545_test.go: a MALFORMED checkip-url must not put its
// credential in the refusal error (#6545 review, security MINOR).
//
// #6545 made CheckIP/CheckIPBound RETURN the reason a probe failed so a
// permanently misconfigured checkip-url stops masquerading as a transient miss.
// The daemon observer then logs that reason (slog.Warn "err", cerr) AND uses its
// text as the checkIPProbeWarned dedup map key. validateCheckIPURL built those
// errors with the RAW url, so the new operator-visible signal wrote a
// query-string API key into journald in cleartext:
//
//	ddns checkip: url "ftp://checkip.example/?apikey=SECRET" must be http(s)
//
// A checkip endpoint with a per-account API key in its query is ordinary
// (ipify, ip-api, and the whole "what is my IP" API tier all offer one), and the
// key is exactly the kind of credential this package redacts everywhere else —
// backend_generic.go runs url-template through config.RedactURL, doRequest runs
// transport errors through scrubURLError. The checkip validator was the hole.
//
// checkIPCredential is the sentinel every case below plants in the position an
// operator's key actually occupies. It is deliberately not a substring of any
// host or scheme in these URLs, so a hit is unambiguous evidence of a leak.
