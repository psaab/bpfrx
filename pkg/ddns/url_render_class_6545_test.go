// url_render_class_6545_test.go: the CLASS gate for URL rendering in pkg/ddns
// (#6545 review round 6).
//
// The first five rounds of this PR each closed ONE surface and left another
// standing — the parse-failure branch, then the validator refusals, then the
// fragment on the transport path. Each fix was correct and each time the next
// review found the same bug one call site over. This file stops that by
// asserting the PROPERTY rather than the instances:
//
//	No error leaving pkg/ddns renders more of a URL than SCHEME://HOST,
//	and every URL-bearing error goes through scrubURLError.
//
// It is enforced from both ends:
//
//   - BEHAVIOURALLY — scrubURLError's output is pinned by EXACT EQUALITY, not by
//     probing for a sentinel, so a field that is neither dropped nor expected
//     fails the gate whether or not anyone thought to plant a secret in it. Plus
//     end-to-end drives through every backend's build-request path.
//   - STRUCTURALLY — TestDDNSURLErrorRendersGoThroughScrubber walks the AST of
//     every production file in the package and fails any site that takes an
//     error from http.NewRequest / url.Parse / client.Do and renders it without
//     the scrubber, and TestClientDoHasExactlyOneCallSite denies the move that
//     would put a round trip somewhere the walk cannot see.
//
// WHAT THE STRUCTURAL HALF IS AND IS NOT (round 7). It is a TRIPWIRE on the
// shapes this leak has actually taken six times running. It is NOT a proof. A
// reviewer walked round 6's version with an aliased import, a `do := client.Do`
// method value, a non-adjacent guard, and an errors.As extraction; those four
// are closed now (importAliases, the .Do site count, reach-based sites,
// extraction taint) but the underlying limit stands — an AST walk cannot follow
// a value through a helper's return, and nothing here claims otherwise. The
// count gate is what makes that limit bite: you cannot introduce the helper
// without failing it.
//
// The BEHAVIOURAL half is the load-bearing one, and it is the half to extend
// first when a new leak shape turns up.
//
// The two MAJORs of round 6, both closed here:
//
//  1. scrubURLError preserved Path. The generic backend accepts %p ANYWHERE in
//     its template, so the supported template "https://prov.example/update/%p"
//     put the expanded password into the transport error — which the Surface A
//     observer logs AND keeps as its process-lifetime dedup key. A checkip-url
//     with an API key in its path had the same exposure.
//  2. The DuckDNS, Cloudflare and both Route 53 build-request paths %w-wrapped
//     the raw *url.Error, which re-embeds the complete offending URL. All three
//     take their endpoint from the `server` leaf UNPARSED, so a credentialed,
//     malformed server value was rendered verbatim.

// buildURLSentinel sits where an operator credential would in a `server` leaf.
// It deliberately begins with a NON-hex byte pair after the '%' so that a URL
// carrying it as "#%<sentinel>" fails url.Parse with an escape error — the
// build-request failure these paths are reached by.
const buildURLSentinel = "BUILD-URL-MUST-NOT-LOG"

// poisonedServer is a `server` value that is credential-bearing AND unparseable:
// url.Parse rejects the fragment's "%BU" escape, and (*url.Error).Error() then
// re-embeds the WHOLE string, sentinel included.

// and reaches the render path — a sentinel that made the URL invalid would test
// the withhold-unparseable branch instead and prove nothing about the host.

//     &url.Error{Op: req.URL.String(), URL: "https://safe.example/"} leaked the
//     whole URL through the one field the scrub skipped.

//     "errno 65432", so a numeric credential survived the "kernel vocabulary"
//     argument.
//  4. %T is not a compile-time symbol. reflect.StructOf builds a runtime type
