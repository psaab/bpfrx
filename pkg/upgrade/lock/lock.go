// Package lock provides a host-wide advisory lock that serializes every
// mutating xpf upgrade operation on a single host (#1965).
//
// Background: the upgrade subsystem (pkg/upgrade, cmd/xpfd/upgrade*.go,
// debian/*) durably writes a crash-safe journal, repoints symlinks, and
// installs systemd drop-ins with NO host-local serialization. Two
// mutators racing (operator `xpfd upgrade` vs the Debian postinst cut, a
// binary cut vs `xpfd upgrade kernel arm`, a `--rolling` driver vs a local
// cut) silently corrupt that state: both loadJournal() the same snapshot,
// modify independent copies, and saveJournal() last-write-wins, losing the
// PreviousVersion / rollback target. Unlike a fixed-name temp-symlink
// collision (which errors cleanly via EEXIST), the journal race is silent.
//
// The fix is one host-wide advisory lock taken by every MUTATING upgrade
// entry point — binary cut, rolling driver, postinst cut, and the mutating
// `xpfd upgrade kernel` sub-verbs (arm/promote/drain/rejoin). Read-only
// status commands stay lock-free.
//
// Design:
//   - The lock is an exclusive non-blocking BSD advisory lock
//     (flock(2), LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB) on /run/xpf/upgrade.lock.
//   - /run is tmpfs and reboot-clearing, which is exactly right: the lock
//     guards against CONCURRENT mutators, while crash recovery is journal-
//     driven (the durable journal lives under /var/lib/xpf). A reboot that
//     interrupts an upgrade leaves no stale lock; the resume reads the
//     journal, not the lock.
//   - /run/xpf is created (mkdir -p) before the acquire — a fresh boot's
//     tmpfs may not have it yet.
//   - Owner metadata (PID, subcommand, target version/kernel, start time)
//     is written into the lock file AFTER the flock succeeds, so a busy
//     error can name the CURRENT owner instead of merely reporting "busy".
//   - flock is advisory and tied to the OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION, not the
//     path: a second open()+flock() on the same path returns EWOULDBLOCK
//     while another fd holds LOCK_EX. The lock is released by closing the
//     fd (Handle.Release), and the kernel also releases it on process
//     exit, so a crashed holder never wedges the host.
//
// Stale-owner-metadata correctness (#1984): the owner metadata is the only
// thing a busy acquirer reads to NAME the holder, and it is written AFTER
// the flock. Without care a busy acquirer can read a PREVIOUS owner's JSON
// as if it were the current holder's, misreporting a long-exited process.
// The mutual exclusion (the flock) is unaffected — this is diagnostics
// correctness. Two truncations, both performed WHILE THE FLOCK IS HELD,
// keep the file empty across the entire ownerless interval:
//   - truncate-on-acquire: the instant AcquireAt holds the flock it
//     Truncate(0)s the file, so the acquire->write window (before the new
//     owner records its own metadata) and a swallowed metadata-write
//     failure both leave an EMPTY file rather than stale JSON. readOwner
//     returns nil on an empty file, so a concurrent busy reader degrades
//     to "busy, owner unknown".
//   - truncate-on-release-under-lock: Release Truncate(0)s the file BEFORE
//     dropping the flock, so the file is already empty the instant the
//     NEXT acquirer can flock it — closing the flock->truncate scheduling
//     gap that truncate-on-acquire alone would leave open.
// Both are f.Truncate(0) on the HELD fd. os.Remove is deliberately NOT
// used: flock binds the inode (open file description), so unlinking the
// path while another fd has it open / awaits it lets a fresh O_CREAT
// acquirer flock a DIFFERENT inode — a split mutex (the #1875 "never rm
// the lock file" lesson). /run is tmpfs (reboot-clearing), so a lingering
// zero-length lock file is harmless.
