// Package manifest is the single source of truth (SSOT) for the set of
// binaries the in-place-upgrade subsystem manages as a version-locked unit
// (#1982).
//
// The upgrade flow treats these binaries as one atomic, lockstep payload:
// the .deb stages them (debian/rules), the maintainer scripts seed/link/
// clean them (debian/xpf.{preinst,postinst,postrm}), the first-install seed
// copies them (pkg/upgrade/runtime), and the verified cut-over copies, flips,
// verifies, and GCs them (pkg/upgrade). Before #1982 the four-binary list was
// hand-duplicated across eight independent edit sites with no guard, so adding
// a future helper meant editing every site by hand and a one-file miss shipped
// a green build that left an old helper in service, failed rollback cleanup, or
// omitted a binary from first-install seeding.
//
// This package centralizes the list. Go consumers (pkg/upgrade and
// pkg/upgrade/runtime) call Names(); the shell maintainer scripts and
// debian/rules keep a self-contained literal (no build-time mutation of
// tracked files), and the drift canary (manifest_drift_test.go) FAILS the
// suite if any shell site diverges from this manifest. So the manifest stays
// the one place a new managed binary is declared, and the canary enforces it.
