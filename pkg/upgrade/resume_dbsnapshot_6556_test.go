// #6556: a RESUMED cut reused the config-DB snapshot taken at the ORIGINAL
// preflight, so a later auto-rollback silently reverted every commit made in
// the interruption window.
//
// cutover.go gated preflight on `!j.State.atLeast(StatePreflight)`, so a
// journal that had already passed PREFLIGHT never re-snapshotted. PREFLIGHT,
// COPY and VERIFY are PURE (state.go invariants) — the daemon stays live and
// accepting commits across them — and the host-wide upgrade lock is NOT held
// across the interruption, so the operator has no signal that a cut is
// pending. The rollback then restores the pre-interruption DB.
//
// The tree documented this exact hazard for the SIBLING case and closed it
// there only: cleanupFailedVerifyCopy rewinds a verify failure to INIT and
// clears DBSnapshotPath because "the daemon stays LIVE across a verify failure
// (verify is pure), so an operator may change the config DB before the retry"
// (#1967, deepened to StateInit + SourceGeneration by #1981).
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: delete the `else if !j.State.atLeast(StateStopped)` arm from
// Run's preflight gate and TestRun_ResumedCutRetakesDBSnapshot6556 goes RED for
// all three live states — the rollback restores the pre-window content.

// POST-upgrade state under the name "pre-upgrade snapshot" and defeat rollback
// entirely, which is strictly worse than the bug being fixed.

// So this asserts the inverse: a resume at FLIPPED must restore the ORIGINAL
// snapshot even though the file changed underneath it.
