// Package sysservices holds the shared, EFFECTIVE management-listener state
// rendered by `show system services`. It is a LEAF package (imports only the
// standard library) so the daemon (which owns the listener lifecycle), the
// local interactive CLI (pkg/cli), and the remote gRPC renderer (pkg/grpcapi)
// can all depend on it without an import cycle.
//
// The point of this package (#6385/#6401): both `show system services`
// renderers — the local CLI (pkg/cli/cli_show_system.go) AND the remote gRPC
// renderer (pkg/grpcapi/server_show_system.go, the path the remote `cli` binary
// reaches) — read ONE daemon-owned snapshot of what each listener is ACTUALLY
// doing, not the requested/config-declared values. Before #6385 both renderers
// hardcoded `127.0.0.1:50051 (always on)` / `127.0.0.1:8080 (always on)`, so a
// relocated, loopback-clamped (#5035/#5127), or disabled listener was reported
// wrong, and a dropped local-only patch (the #6384 A10-b2-F5 attempt) left the
// local and remote surfaces disagreeing. Sourcing both from Lines() guarantees
// they can never diverge again.
//
// #6401 fold: each listener carries a STATE (not just an address) so a
// CONFIGURED-but-FAILED bind is reported as such rather than misread as either
// serving (the old requested-addr fallback) or off ("disabled").
