// #6829 A2: the CLI commit mirror must report an unmappable facility, exactly
// as the daemon does.
//
// buildSyslogClients is documented as "Mirror the daemon exactly" (#5738) and
// runs live via reloadSyslog on an in-process commit. It was left on the
// unchecked logging.ParseFacility on the argument that the schema enum gates
// the name. That holds on the STRICT path only: configstore.Store downgrades
// the gate to a warning on Load (boot) and SyncApply (HA peer sync), which is
// the same reachability class the severity belt exists for. Untold, every
// record on the stream leaves under local0 while `show system syslog` still
// reports the authored name.
//
// The warning is the only observable difference for the checked-vs-unchecked
// CONVERSION itself — both forms return the same code, so no assertion on
// client.Facility can distinguish ParseFacility from ParseFacilityChecked.
//
// The test does BOTH, and the reason is a different property. Since #6829 the
// site has a compute/assign split (classify above the client construction,
// assign below it), and dropping the ASSIGN half is invisible to a log
// assertion — the warning still fires while nothing is installed. So the log
// capture binds the conversion and the client inspection binds the assignment.
// An earlier revision of this comment said the test captures the log RATHER
// THAN inspecting the client; that stopped being true when the inspection was
// added below.
//
// The warn uses slog.Warn rather than the fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr) form its two
// sibling warnings in buildSyslogClients use. That is deliberate: this function
// is documented to mirror the daemon, the daemon site uses slog.Warn, and
// slog.Warn is already the established form elsewhere in pkg/cli (peer.go,
// session_filter.go). Matching the daemon was judged more important than
// matching the two lines above it.
//
// RED-on-revert: put the site back on logging.ParseFacility (or drop the
// !known warn) and the unmapped subtest goes silent.
