// goes through the resolver: a second call site that computed its own class —
// from `$USER`, from a gRPC-supplied name, or from a "default to super-user"
// convenience — would reopen the hole without touching any of the code the
// other tests cover.
//
// That premise — "SetUserClass is the ONE write" — is itself now CHECKED, by
// allowedClassFieldWriters below, rather than asserted here and taken on trust.
// It was true but unbound: both canaries key on the SELECTOR name, `userClass`
// is package-private, and pkg/cli is exactly where the command handlers live,
// so `func (c *CLI) zzPromote() { c.userClass = "super-user" }` in this package
// gave build rc 0, vet rc 0 and every canary plus the whole pkg/cli and
// pkg/daemon suites green (#6706 review r7 F3, reproduced firsthand).

//
//   - `c.userClass = x` — assignment, including `:=` and the multi-value forms;
//     every LHS element is checked, so `a, c.userClass = 1, "super-user"` is
//     caught.
//   - `&c.userClass` — taking the address hands the field to code this file
//     cannot follow, which is the same escape analyzeFuncClassWrite already
//     treats a method VALUE of SetUserClass as.
//   - `CLI{userClass: "super-user"}` — a composite literal constructs the field
//     without ever assigning to it.
//   - `for c.userClass = range xs` — legal Go, and an assignment the AssignStmt
//     arm does not see because RangeStmt carries its own Key/Value.
//   - `c.userClass++` — IncDecStmt is not an AssignStmt. Illegal on today's
//     string field and legal the moment the class becomes an ordinal, which is
//     the wrong time to discover the arm is missing.
//   - `(c.userClass) = x` — the assignment LHS is an *ast.ParenExpr, so a
//     predicate that accepts only a bare *ast.SelectorExpr records ZERO writes
//     for it. Valid Go, and it was invisible: build rc 0, vet rc 0, every canary
//     green (#6706 review r8 F4, reproduced firsthand).
//   - `*c = CLI{}` — WHOLE-OBJECT assignment through a pointer. It names no
//     field at all and sets userClass to "", which checkPermission and
//     showConfigRedacted both read as the legacy allow-everything mode, so this
//     is the most privileged state the RBAC has. `go vet`'s copylocks blocks the
//     `*c = *other` spelling because CLI holds a sync.Mutex, but not this one,
//     and an incidental fence in another tool is not this canary's coverage.
//   - `CLI{a, b, c}` — a POSITIONAL composite literal supplies every field by
//     position, including userClass, with no KeyValueExpr for the keyed arm to
//     see.
//   - `x.CLI = other` — replacing an embedded CLI. No type embeds CLI today;
//     the arm costs one case and closes the shape rather than waiting for one.
//
// READS ARE NOT WRITES. permissions.go reads c.userClass in both of its
// permission gates (:44,51,53 and :94,97) and must not be flagged, which is why
// this keys on assignment POSITION rather than on the selector appearing at
// all — the difference between this and setUserClassRefs, where a bare
// reference IS the violation because a method value defers the write out of
// sight.
//
// KNOWN LIMITS, named rather than implied, because each round of this PR has
// found one more form and the honest statement is where the enumeration stops:
//
//   - The whole-object arms learn which identifiers point AT a CLI from
//     DECLARED types (holderPointerNames), not from a type-checker. A pointer
//     from an untyped source (`p := somethingReturningStar()`) and a double
//     indirection (`**pp`) are not recognised.
//   - A whole-value write into a COLLECTION element — `shells[0] = CLI{}`,
//     `byName[k] = other` — is not recognised: the LHS is an IndexExpr and
//     deciding it needs the element type. There is no `[]CLI`, `[]*CLI` or
//     map-of-CLI anywhere in the tree today (grepped), so no such write exists
//     to catch; a narrower rule keyed on the RHS literal was rejected because
//     partial coverage of a form invites the belief that the form is covered.
//   - reflect and unsafe are outside any AST predicate.
//

//
// The sibling canary above bounds WHO may call SetUserClass. That is necessary
// and not sufficient: the one allowlisted caller could stop calling
// cli.ResolveLoginClass and inline a faithful copy of the resolution logic
// instead. Every behavioural test would still pass — an equivalent copy is
// equivalent, and this was measured, not assumed: mutation M15 inlined exactly
// such a copy into applyCLILoginClass and the WHOLE suite stayed green. The
// policy would then be defined in two places, and the next hardening of
// ResolveLoginClass (a new fail-closed branch, a changed root default) would
// reach only one of them.
//
// What it checks, exactly: for every production function that writes the class,
// (a) it calls ResolveLoginClass, (b) every SetUserClass call takes the
// identifier that received that call's first result, and (c) SetUserClass is
// never referenced as a method value, which would move the write out of view.
//
// This is the same structural binding as pkg/osident's adoption canary, one
// layer up: there the shared thing is the IDENTITY, here it is the POLICY that
// maps that identity onto a class.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: replace the ResolveLoginClass call in applyCLILoginClass with
// an inline equivalent, discard its result and pass a literal, or take a method
// value of SetUserClass INSIDE a function — each names the function and goes
// RED, while the behavioural tests stay green.
//
// One shape this test does NOT catch, named rather than implied: a PACKAGE-LEVEL

// *ast.FuncDecl only, so a GenDecl is invisible to it. That escape is caught by
