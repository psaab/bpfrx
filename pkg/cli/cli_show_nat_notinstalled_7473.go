// #7473: the shared NOT-INSTALLED verdict for the NAT summary renderers.
//
// THE LIE THIS FIXES. The summary family (`show security nat source` and its
// destination twin) rendered rules straight from configuration with no
// indication that the snapshot builder refused to install them. Several of
// them are worse than a plain config echo: they attach a translation-hit
// counter to a rule the dataplane never installed, so
//
//	Rule-set: rs1  Rule: r1  trust -> untrust  Action: pool p1
//	  Translation hits: 0
//
// reads as "no traffic matched" when the truth is "this rule is not armed".
// That points the operator at their traffic instead of their config, which is
// the #6534 archetype.
//
// ONE VERDICT SOURCE. These helpers do not decide anything themselves — they
// call the same pkg/config predicates the snapshot builder and pkg/natshow's
// detail renderers call. The formatter for the summary views remains separate
// from natshow's (consolidating those is a larger refactor), but the VERDICT
// cannot diverge, because there is only one implementation of it and it is not
// here.

// sourceNATRuleNotInstalled reports why a source NAT rule is not installed, or
// "" when it is armed.
//
// A rule translating via `interface` (no pool) has no pool to be unusable, so
// it is reported armed — the pool predicate is the only builder exclusion this
// family has, and inventing a verdict for the interface case would be a claim
// the builder never made.

// natNotInstalledLine renders the operator-facing annotation for a non-empty
// reason, or "" when the rule is armed.
//
// The wording leads with NOT INSTALLED rather than burying the state after the
// reason, because the summary views print one line per rule and the operator is
// scanning, not reading. SourceNATDisarmReasonText expands the raw reason token
// into the remedy-bearing sentence; the destination predicate already returns

// is excluded, or "" otherwise.
//
// A pool is not itself a builder exclusion on the destination family — the
// predicate is per-rule — so the honest verdict for a pool is derived: it is
// not translating only when nothing that could reach it is installed. A pool
// referenced by no rule at all is reported armed rather than not-installed,
// because "unreferenced" is a different statement from "the builder refused
// it", and conflating them would put a NOT INSTALLED banner on a pool the
// operator simply has not wired up yet.
