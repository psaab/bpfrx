// #6987: a session's recorded ingress {ifindex, VLAN} is stamped at INSTALL,
// while `ifaceNamesByKey` is rebuilt from the CURRENT config and the CURRENT
// kernel ifindexes on EVERY query. A kernel ifindex is RECYCLED — a tunnel,
// VLAN unit or XFRM interface is destroyed and its number handed to a different
// interface later — so a stale ifindex does not merely MISS the rebuilt table.
// It can HIT it and name an interface the session never arrived on, and there
// was nothing in the output to tell that apart from a correct answer: one
// confident WRONG interface name, and an interface filter selecting rows for
// traffic that never touched the named interface.
//
// The row carries one other identity recorded at the same instant — its ingress
// ZONE, whose id is name-derived and stable across commits (assignZoneIDs) — so
// the hit is corroborated against it. A disagreement is treated as a miss.
//
// Each test below carries its own over-reach control, because "stop naming the
// interface" and "stop resolving the identity at all" are indistinguishable
// without one.
