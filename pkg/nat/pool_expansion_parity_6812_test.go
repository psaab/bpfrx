// #6812 B2 — the deterministic-NAT expander is the THIRD consumer of the
// source-NAT pool grammar, and the one where a network-base drift stops being
// "wrong addresses" and becomes a Go/Rust divergence.
//
// expandPoolV4 enumerates a pool CIDR from net.ParseCIDR's ipnet.IP, which is
// already masked to the network base, and lookupForwardInPool INDEXES that
// slice (p.poolV4[ipIdx]) to answer the operator-facing question "which
// external address does this subscriber translate to?". The Rust expander
// (expand_pool_address, userspace-dp/src/nat/source.rs) computes its own base
// with a hand-rolled mask that #6812 round 3 wrote to replace IpNet::network().
//
// If those two bases disagree, the CLI/gRPC/REST deterministic mapping names a
// different external address than the dataplane actually translates to —
// off by exactly the host bits — which is the #5794 invariant-8 forensic
// failure (the reverse map attributing a tuple to the wrong subscriber), and
// it is a divergence of precisely the kind this PR exists to close, on a line
// this PR authored.
//
// Nothing bound it: the shared fixture asserted verdict and host COUNT, and a
// missing mask changes WHICH addresses are produced and never HOW MANY.
// (`10.0.0.1/24` still yields 256 addresses unmasked — it just walks
// 10.0.0.1 .. 10.0.1.0, one address into the NEIGHBOURING prefix.) This test
// reads the SAME fixture the Rust expander and the Go grammar predicate read,
// so all three consumers are pinned to one table.
