// #8642: a repo-wide census of `time.Duration(x) * time.<Unit>` sites, so the
// NINETEENTH unbounded config knob reds here instead of shipping.
//
// THE FAMILY. A config seconds/milliseconds knob is stored by the compiler as a
// plain `int` from `strconv.Atoi` with no range check, and a consumer computes
// `time.Duration(n) * time.Second`. Past `MaxDurationSeconds` the multiply
// overflows int64 nanoseconds and WRAPS — and the residue can be small and
// POSITIVE (`gcd(1e9, 2^64) = 512`, so 512ns for seconds; `gcd(1e6, 2^64) = 64`
// for milliseconds). Every guard this swept was `<= 0` or `> 0`, and every one
// of them is blind to that by construction: **a guard asking "is it nonsense in
// the obvious direction" cannot see wrap, because wrap is not nonsense.**
//
// The project fixed this family FOUR times one package at a time (#5705, #5723,
// #6769, #8597) before #8642 counted what was left. Five private copies of one
// three-line clamp is how the sixth site gets missed.
//
// WHY THIS PARSES RATHER THAN GREPS. A regex over the same pattern is wrong in
// both directions, measured:
//
//   - It counts PROSE. `pkg/config/schema_interfaces.go` has a `valueDesc`
//     string that describes this very hazard; a grep scores it as an instance.
//   - It counts the multiply INSIDE a bounding helper, after the bound — which
//     made all five already-fixed packages look unswept when the census was
//     first run against them.
//
// WHY A FIXPOINT RATHER THAN AN ALLOWLIST (the #8629 shape). A site is safe when
// its operand is bounded, OR when it comes from a function that bounds it. That
// accepts the shared converters and each package's own hardening helper by
// CONSTRUCTION, rather than by a hand-maintained exemption list that would
// happily keep blessing a helper which had stopped bounding.

// unitFactor names the time units whose multiply can overflow from a plausible
// config integer. Hour/Minute are included because #5784 was the minutes
// straggler of this same class.
var overflowUnits = map[string]bool{
	"Second": true, "Millisecond": true, "Minute": true, "Hour": true,

// boundingCalls are the primitives that establish a bound. A function becomes
// bound-clean by calling one of these, and the fixpoint then spreads that
// property to its callers.

	"MillisToDuration":  true,
	"MinutesToDuration": true,

// isBoundingConstant reports whether an identifier names a ceiling denominated
// in one of the overflow-capable units.
//
// This is a NAME PATTERN, not a fixed list, and the first draft was a fixed list
// of the three MaxDuration* constants. That list was wrong within one run: the
// census flagged `withinWindow` (#8597, already fixed) because it bounds against
// the domain-specific `config.MaxEventWithinSeconds` instead. A hand-maintained
// list of ceilings is the allowlist-rot failure the fixpoint exists to avoid,
// one level down — the NEXT domain ceiling would red a correctly-bounded site,
// and the usual response to that noise is to weaken the guard.
//
// A name pattern alone would be a naming heuristic, so it is not alone:

// ceiling this accepts is actually at or below the arithmetic's overflow point.
