// #8597 (muse-004 K17) / gemini-review-048 finding 17 — the VRRP half of the
// same defect: a wide config int reaching a narrow wire field, with the LOCAL
// decision made on the wide value.
//
// `instance_send.go` writes `Priority: uint8(priority)` while the local state
// machine reads `vi.cfg.Priority` as an int (instance_preempt.go, three sites)
// — so a configured 256 advertised as 0. 0 is not a low priority in VRRP; it is
// the RFC 5798 RESIGNATION beacon this package uses to hand mastership over
// (manager.go ResignRG). The node would tell the LAN "take over now" on every
// advert while believing itself the most preferred candidate.
//
// #8321 dispositioned this finding as mechanism-real, reachability NOT
// established: "I have not found such a path and I am not asserting there is
// none." The path is the tolerant ingress, the same one K17 travels, and
// TestLenientLoadKeepsAnOutOfRangeVRRPPriority_8597 below drives it rather than
// asserting it.

// TestLenientLoadKeepsAnOutOfRangeVRRPPriority_8597 answers the #8321 open
// question by execution: the strict gate rejects, the tolerant compile keeps
// the raw value, and the value is one that truncates to the resignation beacon.
