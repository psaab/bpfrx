// #7625: `filterDefinedPolicies` returns the SURVIVING SUBSET of an authored
// policy chain, silently discarding any member that names a policy-statement
// which is not defined. That produces two materially different outcomes:
//
//	authored chain        after the drop   outcome
//	[undefined]           []               no attachment emitted -> PERMIT-ALL
//	[defined, undefined]  [defined]        attachment still emitted -> SILENT NARROWING
//
// The second is the more insidious, precisely because it is invisible: the
// neighbour still carries A filter, the session works, and `show route-map`
// shows a real, well-formed policy — it is simply not the policy the operator
// wrote. Nothing anywhere reports that a member of the authored chain was
// discarded.
//
// WHY THE EXISTING #6807 HELPER CANNOT SEE IT. `danglingRouteMapRefs6807`
// compares references emitted in the rendered section against definitions
// emitted in that same section. A NARROWED chain still references a route-map
// that really is defined, so the rendered section is perfectly self-consistent
// and the helper — correctly, for its own question — reports nothing. Detecting
// narrowing needs the AUTHORED chain, which the rendered text does not contain.
// `TestDanglingHelperIsBlindToNarrowing7625` proves that rather than asserting
// it.
//
// This detector is deliberately DECISION-INDEPENDENT. #7625 has an open
// behaviour choice (keep dropping / emit a bounded deny / split by direction),
// and its own text says whichever option is taken must cover BOTH shapes. This
// helper is what lets any of them be asserted; it changes no behaviour.

// from the authored one.
