// #8597 (muse-004 K19) — claimWithdrawOnceLocked bumped the per-interface
// supersession epoch for EVERY interface it was handed, including the ones it
// then skipped.
//
// The pairing invariant this package runs on is that a supersession bump
// accompanies real superseding RESPONSIBILITY. Withdraw flips the global fence
// and owns every drain. WithdrawInterfaces bumps and then flips goodbyeWanted
// on the entry it supersedes, so even its "already draining" path takes over
// the goodbye. WithdrawOnce's skip path bumped and did NEITHER: it emitted
// nothing, claimed nothing, and reported Skipped — while cancelling whatever
// the current owner was in the middle of.
//
// The consumers both key on that epoch. finishDrainDecision starts a
// changed-config replacement only if `m.ifaceEpoch[name] == e.startIfaceEpoch`;
// applyDeferred aborts a deferred start on the same comparison. A stray bump
// therefore makes the replacement silently not happen, the tombstone get
// deleted anyway, and BOTH error returns stay nil — the interface ends with no
// RA sender and every caller is told it succeeded. Hosts behind it keep the
// router until Router Lifetime (1800s default) expires.
//
// The trigger is not exotic: the daemon runs runStartupGoodbye in its own
// goroutine (pkg/daemon/daemon_ha.go), so a cold-boot WithdrawOnce runs
// concurrently with Apply's changed-config restart.

// TestWithdrawOnceSkipDoesNotCancelARestart_8597 is the RED-on-revert core.
//
// lo carries an in-flight changed-config restart (a drainEntry with no live
// sender). WithdrawOnce naming lo finds it busy and SKIPS — so it must leave
// lo's restart alone. Restoring the unconditional bump loop makes the
// replacement never start and this cell fails with lo senderless.
