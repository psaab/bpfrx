// Package zonecounters carries the single canonical operator-facing wording for
// a security zone whose per-zone traffic counters are unavailable.
//
// IT IS A DEPENDENCY-FREE LEAF ON PURPOSE (#6895). Three surfaces print this
// state — the local CLI (pkg/cli), the gRPC text renderer (pkg/grpcapi) and the
// remote cli binary (cmd/cli) — and the natural home would be pkg/dataplane,
// beside the ErrCounterNotPopulated sentinel these sentences describe. But the
// #1451 retirement-boundary canary deliberately keeps cmd/cli free of root
// pkg/dataplane: the remote cli speaks gRPC and must not link the dataplane.
// Adding an allowlist entry to share two strings would weaken an intentional
// architectural boundary for a presentation concern, so the wording lives in a
// leaf all three may import and the boundary stays as designed.
package zonecounters

// The wording below is the rendering of dataplane.ErrCounterNotPopulated for a
// security zone.
//
// SINGLE-SOURCED ON PURPOSE (#6895). Three surfaces report this same state --
// the local CLI (pkg/cli), the gRPC text renderer (pkg/grpcapi) and the remote
// cli binary (cmd/cli) -- and before #6895 the generic sentence was duplicated
// verbatim in two of them with no test binding the agreement. They describe ONE
// dataplane condition, so a divergence between them is always a bug: an
// operator comparing two surfaces would reasonably read different wording as
// different states.
//
// Checking that agreement is also what surfaced a real gap: the local CLI had
// the #6845 overflow specialisation and the gRPC text renderer did NOT, so the
// same cluster reported slot exhaustion on one surface and the generic
// three-cause line on the other. Routing every surface through UnavailableLine
// fixes that by construction.
//
// WHY THE GENERIC LINE STAYS AMBIGUOUS. ReadZoneCounters returns
// ErrCounterNotPopulated for a pre-#3651 helper, a zone past the helper's
// hot-path slot capacity, AND a merely idle zone, because the helper's status
// snapshot is sparse and omits all-zero rows. Those three are genuinely
// indistinguishable at this layer and naming one would be a guess. The overflow
// line is different: when the helper reports its slot table has overflowed, that
// cause is KNOWN, it is the only one of the three that needs action, and traffic
// really is going uncounted.

// old helper — the exact conflation #7087 is about, reintroduced in the shim.
const unknownLayoutVersion = LayoutVersionUnknown

// LayoutVersionUnknown is what a caller passes when it could not read a status

// those are different sentences.
const LayoutVersionUnknown = ^uint32(0)

// UnavailableLineFor names WHICH of the three causes applies, when the wire says.
//
// #7087: the doc above this file's constants said the three causes are
// "genuinely indistinguishable at this layer and naming one would be a guess."
// That was true only because the layout-version field had no reader. It does
// carry the answer:
//
//	layoutVersion == 0   the helper predates per-zone accounting — KNOWN, and
//	                     not actionable on this box: it needs a helper upgrade.
//	overflowActive       the slot table is exhausted — KNOWN and actionable.
//	otherwise            a helper that publishes, with room, reporting nothing
//	                     for this zone: the zone is IDLE. Also known.
//
// So with both fields all three are distinguishable and none is a guess. The
// generic line survives only for callers that cannot supply a layout version.
//
// Order matters: an old helper publishes no overflow bit either, so the version
// check must come first or an upgrade-needed box would be reported as
// slot-exhausted — a wrong AND actionable diagnosis, which is worse than an
// ambiguous one.
