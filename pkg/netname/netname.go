// Package netname derives the predictable network-interface name udev would
// assign to a NIC. It is the SINGLE SOURCE for that derivation (#7426).
//
// # Why single-source rather than an agreement test
//
// Two re-implementations of this contract existed — `deriveKernelName`
// (pkg/daemon) and `getOriginalKernelName` (pkg/dataplane) — and they were
// wrong in OPPOSITE directions on the same field:
//
//   - altname selection: the daemon copy applied systemd's NamePolicy order;
//     the dataplane copy took the first match in whatever order the kernel
//     listed.
//   - the PCI `f0` suffix: the dataplane copy carried #4795's multifunction fix
//     ("getOriginalKernelName appends f0 for single-function PCI" — an
//     OVER-emission bug); the daemon copy tested `fn > 0` and so never emitted
//     `f0` at all, an UNDER-emission bug on a genuine multifunction device.
//
// An agreement test can only pin one copy's behaviour to the other's. On the
// `f0` field there is no direction to pin that is correct for both, because
// neither was right — so agreement would have frozen a bug rather than caught
// one. That is the general rule this package exists to illustrate: BIND an
// agreement when both copies can be right; SINGLE-SOURCE when they are wrong in
// opposite directions.
//
// # Package placement
//
// This is a deliberate leaf with ZERO xpf imports. `pkg/daemon` imports
// `pkg/dataplane` and not the reverse, so a resolver living in `pkg/daemon`
// compiles fine right up until `pkg/dataplane` needs it. `pkg/devicemap` was
// the other candidate, but `pkg/dataplane` does not import it today and adding
// that edge is a larger commitment than a zero-import leaf.
