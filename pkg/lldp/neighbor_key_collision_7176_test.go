// #7176 (C179-026). The neighbor table used a "%s/%s/%s"-joined string key over
// the interface name and two PEER-CONTROLLED TLV strings. Port IDs legitimately
// contain "/" (a Junos-style ge-0/0/1), so the join is ambiguous — and because a
// TTL=0 LLDPDU is an explicit withdrawal that deletes BY KEY, a peer able to
// choose its own ChassisID/PortID could forge the key of a DIFFERENT neighbor
// and evict an entry it does not own.
//
// The fixture is the smallest shape where the ambiguity produces a wrong
// outcome, and both rows format to the SAME legacy string:
//
//	victim:   chassis "aa"    port "bb/cc"  -> "eth0/aa/bb/cc"
//	attacker: chassis "aa/bb" port "cc"     -> "eth0/aa/bb/cc"
//
// Reverting neighborKey to the joined string makes the eviction succeed and
// this test RED.
