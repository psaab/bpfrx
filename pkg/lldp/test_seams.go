// Test-only helpers for pkg/lldp. They live in the production package so tests
// in DEPENDENT packages (pkg/daemon) can drive Apply's failure modes without
// real NICs or CAP_NET_RAW. That matters for #6794 specifically: the recovery
// guard spans both packages, and a test that could only reach these seams from
// inside pkg/lldp would bind Apply's RETURN VALUE while leaving the caller free
// to ignore it — which was the whole defect. Not for production callers.
// Mirrors the pkg/configstore/test_seams.go convention.

// SetInterfaceByNameForTesting overrides the kernel interface lookup used by
// Manager.Apply AND by InterfaceResolvable — deliberately the same seam, so a
// test cannot make those two disagree in a way production never could. Pass nil
// to restore net.InterfaceByName.

// FailIfSessionForTesting makes every per-interface socket setup fail with err,
// so Apply can be exercised without CAP_NET_RAW: name resolution still runs
// (which is what #6794's unresolved set reports), and no real socket is opened
// or goroutine started. Pass nil to restore the real newIfSession.
