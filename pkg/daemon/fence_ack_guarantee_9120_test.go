// #9120: FenceAckOK's prose said the peer "confirms it relinquished every RG it
// knows about, which is the property a takeover gate should be built on".
//
// This cell PINS WHAT THE ACK ACTUALLY PROVES, so the gap cannot widen in
// silence and no future gate is built on the stronger reading:
//
//  1. the fence drives rg_active=false for every live-config RG   (it does)
//  2. it does NOT change cluster state — clusterPri stays true    (it does not)
//  3. it does NOT release VIPs                                    (it does not)
//  4. the very next reconcile pass re-drives rg_active=true       (it does)
//
// (4) is #6530's pinned behaviour and this cell is deliberately its COUNTERPART
// rather than its inversion: TestFenceRearmsReconcileRetry asserts the retry
// must re-drive, and it must keep passing. What #9120 adds is that the retry
// re-driving is the same event as the fence EXPIRING — so the durability of the
// relinquishment is one reconcile interval, not indefinite.
//
// AND THE REFRAMING THAT MATTERS FOR THE REAL FIX: the revert is NOT the fence
// being undone. `desired = clusterPri || allVrrpMaster`, and the fence changes
// NEITHER input — so the state machine correctly observes that desired is still
// true and retries an apply that never should have been reverted. #6530 is
// about retrying a FAILED apply; it does not exist to undo a fence, and a
// future fix that makes the fence a cluster-state event (dropping clusterPri)
// does not contradict it — it removes the input that keeps desired true.
