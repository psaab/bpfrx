// Package daemon implements the xpf daemon lifecycle.
//
// This file implements D3 RSS indirection persistence (issue #785).
//
// For mlx5_core-driven interfaces that will be bound to userspace-dp with
// N workers, we reshape the hardware RSS indirection table so that hash
// outputs land only on queues 0..N-1. Queues N..RX_count-1 are weighted 0
// and never receive traffic. This avoids the wasted kernel-fallback path
// on queues that no userspace worker consumes.
//
// Why a sibling file to linksetup.go (not inline): the weight-vector
// computation is a pure function with several edge cases that deserve
// their own unit tests; keeping it here lets the tests live beside the
// logic without bloating linksetup.go, which already owns PCI enumeration
// and .link-file management.
//
// Applied strictly before any AF_XDP socket binding opens an RX ring on
// first boot — driven from enumerateAndRenameInterfaces() at daemon
// startup. The reviewer's #M4 concern (no mid-traffic re-hash) is
// addressed by call ordering: this runs from Run() before the dataplane
// is loaded, so RX rings do not yet exist.
//
// Re-applied from the daemon reconcile path (applyConfig) on every
// commit, so changes to `system dataplane workers` or the
// `rss-indirection enable|disable` knob take effect without a restart.
// Re-application is idempotent (matching tables skip the write) and
// strictly per-interface (capability-probed at both the top-level scan and the
// per-interface call site).

// #9040: eligibility is a CAPABILITY, not a driver name. Every allowlisted
// netdev is probed with `ethtool -x`; one that exposes a readable indirection
// table is reshaped, and one that does not is left alone with the queue cap
// (reported at bring-up, #9262) as its whole remedy.
//
// Invariants:
//   - Runs at daemon startup (and on reconcile for worker-count changes),
//     before the dataplane binds any AF_XDP socket on startup.
//   - `allowed` is the userspace-dp binding allowlist — the authoritative
//     set of Linux interface names that AF_XDP will bind. Only members
//     of that set are ever considered, and every member is still passed
//     probed for indirection support. An empty allowlist is treated as
//     "no interfaces to touch" (no-op) — never a fall-back to scanning
//     every netdev. Review finding Codex H1.
//   - Interfaces with no readable indirection table are skipped after the
//     `ethtool -x` probe. NOTE (#9040): `ethtool -x` IS now invoked on
//     non-mlx5 netdevs — that is the probe. What is never invoked on them
//     is the `ethtool -X` WRITE, which is gated on the read having
//     succeeded and parsed. The previous contract ("ethtool is never
//     invoked on virtio, iavf, i40e") no longer holds and was the reason
//     those NICs silently dropped transit on unbound queues.
//   - enabled == false is a hard kill switch: restore the default
//     indirection table on every allowlisted interface that supports one.
//   - workers == 1: no weight vector is applied (single worker benefits
//     from default RSS spreading across all HW queues / IRQ lines;
//     weight-pinning to a single queue would serialize the worker on one
//     IRQ — reviewer #L1). BUT the allowlist is still walked so the live
//     table is probed and reset to default if it carries a stale
//     concentrated layout left over from a prior workers < queue_count
//     apply — a day-2 workers→1 reduction must not leave RX hashed onto
//     the old subset of queues (#5124).
//   - workers >= queue_count: weight reshaping is skipped (default
//     table already delivers to every queue), BUT the live table is
//     probed and reset to default if it carries a stale concentrated
//     layout left over from a prior workers < queue_count apply (#805).
//   - Idempotent: if the live indirection table already matches the
//     computed layout, no write is issued.
//   - Never returns a non-nil error — D3 regressions must not break
//     interface bring-up.

// #7497: `active` is bounded by BOUND queues, not by `workers` alone.
//
// This function's purpose, per the file header, is that hash outputs land only
// on queues a userspace worker consumes. It expressed that as `[1]*workers`,
// which was equivalent while the planner bound one queue per worker id across
// every interface. It is no longer: the planner now binds
// `min(rx_queues, BindingQueuesPerIface)` queues per interface, so a NIC with
// more RX queues than the stride has queues with NO socket at all, and feeding
// them is not merely wasteful — the shim resolves no binding and takes
// `drop_degraded_transit`, so every transit packet steered there is dropped
// while the interface reads up.
//
// Measured before the change, with the planner capping bindings at 16:
//
//	workers=20 hwq=32 -> fed 20, bound 16   (queues 16-19 fed, no socket)
//	workers=17 hwq=32 -> fed 17, bound 16   (queue 16 fed, no socket)
//	workers=20 hwq=20 -> SKIPPED, fed 20    (the skip branch, not the vector)
//	workers=1  hwq=32 -> SKIPPED, fed 32    (the workers==1 branch)
//
// The last two matter for how this is fixed: they never reach vector
// construction, so bounding only the vector would leave them wrong.
//
// The single-worker case keeps its #5124 intent — do not concentrate onto one
// queue and serialize the worker on one IRQ — but spreads across the BOUND
// queues rather than every hardware queue.

// #9040: this replaces a hard `driver == mlx5_core` gate. The gate was not
// wrong about mlx5 — it was answering the wrong question. `computeWeightVector`
// has always been driver-generic (it clamps `active` to
// min(queues, BindingQueuesPerIface) for anything it is called on), so the
// clamp was never the gap; the gap was one level up, where a non-mlx5 NIC with
// more RX queues than workers never reached the generic clamp at all and
// transit on the unbound queues was dropped.
//
// WHY A PROBE RATHER THAN DROPPING THE GATE. `ethtool -X` indirection support
// varies by driver: i40e/ice/bnxt accept the table write, virtio-net may not,
// and this whole path deliberately swallows its errors because a D3 regression
// must never break interface bring-up. Simply widening the gate would have
// produced a reshape that silently succeeds on some drivers and silently fails
// on others — **the same class of defect this issue is about, re-created one
// layer up**: a mitigation indistinguishable from healthy when it does not work.
//
// Reading the table first turns "which global policy" into a per-interface
// answer, and it identifies the unsupported case BEFORE the write instead of
// after it, which is what makes the swallowed-error path stop mattering. A NIC
// whose table cannot be read is in the refuse-or-tolerate bucket, where the
// #9262 bring-up warning plus the degraded-path counter are the whole remedy.

// The probe costs nothing on the path it replaces: applyRSSIndirectionOne
// already read this table for its idempotency check, so an mlx5 interface
