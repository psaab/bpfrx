// syslog_gate_render_agreement_6844_test.go -- #6844.
//
// The commit-time facility gate and the render belt must accept the SAME set.
//
// A gate looser than the belt produces the failure class #6844 exists to close:
// the config commits, the operator is told nothing, and the destination
// silently disappears at render — reconcileSyslogDropins does not merely skip
// the drop-in, it REMOVES the one a previous apply wrote. A gate tighter than
// the belt is the opposite regression: a strict-commit-clean, rsyslog-valid
// destination stops committing on upgrade.
//
// The first cut of the gate managed both at once. It rejected `auth,authpriv`
// and bare `*` — documented, supported, render-asserted forms — while admitting
// `.` and `_`, which the belt drops.
//
// They now share one predicate (config.SyslogSelectorFacilitySafe), so this
// holds by construction. That is exactly why the test is worth having: a future
// edit that gives either side its own alphabet again reds here, naming the
// token and the direction.
