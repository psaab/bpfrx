// The #7162 no-RETH startup promotion hold.
//
// RETH VRRP mode has had a bounded startup suppression since #466:
// `vrrp.Manager.SetSyncHold(30s)`, armed once at daemon bringup and released by
// bulk session sync or by its own timer. `no-reth-vrrp` and
// `private-rg-election` mode had no equivalent — `checkNoRethTakeoverReadiness`
// is VIP ownership and nothing else — so a node in those modes could promote an
// RG at startup before bulk sync had delivered any conntrack/NAT state, and
// every established TCP flow reset on the transition.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It is not a continuous `IsSyncReady()` conjunct
// in the readiness AND. That is the shape #110 measured and rejected, and it is
// worth stating so nobody "simplifies" this into it: `syncReady` has no bound
// while the session-sync channel is down (`armSyncReadyTimer` early-returns
// unless `d.syncPeerConnected`), and the election blocks a not-ready RG whenever
// the peer is alive. Peer alive on the CONTROL link with session sync down would
// then block promotion INDEFINITELY — including the degraded-peer case
// (peer up, weight 0, interfaces down) that preemption exists to handle.
//
// So the hold is bounded by construction:
//
//   - it is armed EXACTLY ONCE, at daemon bringup, mirroring SetSyncHold's
//     arming scope. It is never re-armed on reconnect, which is what keeps it a
//     STARTUP hold rather than a mid-life block.
//   - its timer callback consults NO peer condition — not `syncPeerConnected`,
//     not `peerAlive`, not `cluster.IsSyncReady()`. This is the #110 trap
//     restated: `armSyncReadyTimer`'s callback bails on `!d.syncPeerConnected`,
//     so that fallback never fires in exactly the peer-absent case it exists
//     for. A release that depended on the peer would be no release at all,
//     because the peer being absent is the reason the hold is still held.
//
// The two release edges are bulk-sync completion (the good one) and the timer
// (the degraded one), and both record which fired so `show chassis cluster` can
// say so.

// noRethSyncHoldTimeout mirrors the RETH VRRP sync hold's 30s. Same job, same
// bound, so an operator reading either path sees the same startup behaviour.
const noRethSyncHoldTimeout = 30 * time.Second
