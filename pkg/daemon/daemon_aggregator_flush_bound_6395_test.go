// daemon_aggregator_flush_bound_6395_test.go — #6395 regression coverage.
//
// stopAggregator's cancel triggers SessionAggregator.Run's #5313 ctx.Done final
// flush, which forwards the pending report SYNCHRONOUSLY through the syslog
// client (logFn -> er.ForwardLogMsg). A stream-syslog sink allows up to
// defaultWriteTimeout (~4s) PER line, so a stalled/unreachable collector makes
// that forward block. stopAggregator runs in runShutdownSequence BEFORE the HA
// takeover fence, so before #6395 the plain `d.aggWg.Wait()` join was UNBOUNDED:
// a stalled sink could delay the fence long enough to blow the systemd 20s
// TimeoutStopSec and get the process SIGKILLed before the peer takeover ran.
//
// The join is now bounded by aggregatorFlushJoinTimeout. These tests prove the
// bound fires on a stalled flush (RED-on-revert: reverting to a plain
// d.aggWg.Wait() blocks forever, so the stop never returns and the generous
// in-test timeout trips a clean t.Fatal) and that the happy path — a fast flush
// — is not penalized by the bound.
