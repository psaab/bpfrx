// #6743 r2-N3: the scoped `-race` gate must actually cover the tests whose
// property it exists to check.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG, measured at 710a87569. The Makefile's `test-race-dp`
// target ran
//
//	go test -race ./pkg/daemon/ -run 'DataplaneCell|NATPoolAlarm|ForwardingStatus|BootstrapExit' -count=2
//
// which matched 19 of pkg/daemon's 1118 tests — and NONE of the tests this
// PR added that actually run a loop goroutine against a concurrently
// emptied cell: the seven in daemon_ha_userspace_stream_live_test.go
// matched nothing, nor did the seven capability tests, nor the escape
// tests. A PR whose headline gate is `-race` shipped that gate excluding
// its own concurrency tests.
//
// WHY A WIDER REGEX ALONE IS NOT THE FIX. A `-run` filter is a NAME
// predicate over a PROPERTY-defined set ("tests that exercise concurrent
// access to the #2114 cell"). Widening it fixes today's omission and
// leaves the mechanism that produced it: the next test added to one of
// these files is outside the gate the moment its name does not happen to
// match, and nothing says so. That is the same NAME-for-PROPERTY
// substitution this campaign has now hit seven times.
//
// So the regex is widened AND this canary makes the coverage itself an
// assertion: every Test function in the declared concurrency-binder files
// must match the regex the Makefile actually passes to -run. Add a test to
// one of those files with a name outside the pattern and this goes RED
// with the name and the fix.
//
// STATED RESIDUAL. The FILE list below is hand-maintained, so a
// concurrency binder written into a brand-new file is invisible here until
// the file is added. That is a strictly smaller and more visible surface
// than a name regex over 1118 tests, but it is not zero, and it is stated
// rather than implied: this canary binds "the regex has not fallen behind
// these files", not "these files are all the concurrency binders there
// are".

// raceGateConcurrencyFiles are the pkg/daemon test files whose tests drive
// the #2114 dataplane cell concurrently — a loop goroutine, a sampler
// overlap, a publish/disown against a live reader, or a management server
// resolving through the live indirection while the cell changes.
