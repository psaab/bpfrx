// #7187 render half: a file/user destination carrying several authored
// selectors must render ONE drop-in whose selector field names all of them.
//
// A destination is one target — a log path, or an omusrmsg account — so it gets
// one xpf-managed drop-in named after it. rsyslog's selector field already
// expresses a set: semicolon-separated `facility.priority` pairs are OR'd,
// which is Junos' meaning for several statements under one stanza. Rendering
// one pair and dropping the rest would move #7187's discard from the compiler
// into the renderer rather than fixing it.
