// #6811: the SEND-PATH half of the multi-family cross-fan.
//
// pkg/flowexport proves the resolver now partitions collectors into one group
// per (template, address family). That alone does not stop the cross-fan: the
// fan-out lives here, in flowExportCallback, which gates the INSTANCE once via
// ServesFamily and then sends the record to EVERY group of that instance.
// Delete the per-group gate and every resolver cell stays green while the bug
// is fully restored — so this cell exists to bind the gate, not the grouping.
//
// The existing #2462 isolation test looks like it covers this and does not: it
// uses two family-DISJOINT instances, where the instance-level ServesFamily gate
// is sufficient. The defect needs ONE instance holding BOTH families, which no
// test configured. That is precisely why it went unnoticed, and the strict
// validator explicitly permits the shape.

// oneInstanceBothFamiliesV9Config is the shape the defect needs: a single
// sampling instance with an inet flow-server AND an inet6 flow-server, each
// pointed at its own collector port so a cross-fan is directly observable.
