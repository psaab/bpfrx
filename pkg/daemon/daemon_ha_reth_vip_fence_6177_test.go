// #6177 item 1 — the remote-failover applied-ack must be fenced on the RETH
// VIPs actually LEAVING the interface, not on the resignation having been
// signalled.
//
// #5640 withheld the ack until the demotion was "actuated", but on the
// RETH-VRRP path ResignRG only writes priority-0 synchronously and then does a
// non-blocking send on resignCh: the advert burst and the becomeBackup VIP
// removal run afterwards, on the VRRP instance goroutine. The peer therefore
// received "applied" and promoted — adding VIPs, sending GARP — while this node
// still owned the virtual address. Sub-millisecond, but a genuine two-owner
// window, and the reason the issue carries the security label.
//
// Direct-VIP mode (`private-rg-election` / `no-reth-vrrp`) never had the gap and
// is covered unchanged by the #6371 tests, which run on that path.

// fakeVIPRelease is a caller-driven vipReleaseBarrier standing in for
// *vrrp.ResignBarrier, so this test drives the ORDERING without real VRRP
// instances or live netlink. pkg/vrrp owns the "the barrier tracks the real VIP
// removal" half (resign_barrier_6177_test.go); this file owns the "the daemon
// waits for it" half.
