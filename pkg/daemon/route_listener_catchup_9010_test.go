// #9010: a gap between route subscriptions is invisible to the update stream.
//
// The subscription is opened with ListExisting:false, so a NEW subscription
// replays nothing. Every route that changed while there was no subscription is
// therefore lost to `updates` permanently, and the outer loop's resubscribe
// closes the socket gap without closing the DATA gap.
//
// WHY #8915 DOES NOT COVER THIS. That fix marks from the ErrorCallback, which
// exists only for a fault during a LIVE subscription. A subscribe that FAILS
// never installs a callback at all -- the 2-second retry path marks nothing --
// and a subscription that simply ends returns before any error is raised.
//
// AND THE MARK IS READ TO MAKE A DECISION, which is what makes a missing one a
// defect rather than a cosmetic omission: the coalescer actuates only when
// dirty. #8915 measured 0 actuations across 50 sweeps with no mark, 1 after a
// single mark. There is no periodic floor to fall back on -- that alternative
// was considered and deliberately declined on #8915.
//
// This drives the function PRODUCTION calls (`routeListenerCatchUp`), not a
// re-implementation, for the same reason the #8915 cell drives
// `routeListenerErrorCallback`.
