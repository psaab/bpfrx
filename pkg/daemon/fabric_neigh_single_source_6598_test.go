// #6598: the fabric peer-MAC validity predicate lives in exactly one place,
// dpuserspace.FabricNeighUsable. Two resolvers for "which MAC answers for the
// fabric peer" disagreeing about what a usable neighbour is IS the defect, so
// this is a case for one definition rather than two that happen to agree.
//
// Re-duplication is easy and silent: before this fix daemon_ha_fabric.go held
// the named const, two address-matched call sites at different indentation, and
// a FOURTH copy written as an inline mask expansion that no search for the
// const name would ever have found.
//
// The scan is over the AST, not the text, so a comment mentioning NUD_FAILED
// (this file's own explanation, or a future one in the source) cannot satisfy
// or trip it — identifiers are identifiers and comments are not in the tree.
