// Two independent reasons to REFUSE, and they answer different questions:
//
//   - The invalidation counter moved. Some OTHER writer touched rg_active while
//     this apply was in flight and armed the retry debt (the cluster fence does
//     exactly this, #6530). Recording convergence now would erase that debt, and
//     the erasure is not temporary: reconcileLocked only SETS applyPending when
//     applied != active, so once this clears it with the two in agreement,
//     nothing re-arms it and reconcileRGState's `tr.Changed || s.NeedsApply()`
//     retry never fires again. Forwarding then stays wherever the other writer
//     left it — precisely the "fenced-then-recovered primary stays dark forever"
//     failure #6530 was written to prevent.
//   - The epoch moved AND the desired value no longer matches what was written.
//     A moved epoch alone is routine (reconcileLocked bumps it every 2s pass),
//     so refusing on it alone would reject nearly every apply; what matters is
//     whether the value this caller wrote is still the value the machine wants.
