// Daemon-side wiring for #801 Phase-B Step-0 host tunables.
//
// This file owns the state machine for the B1 opt-in gate and the B2
// restore-on-disable path. The pure capture/restore logic lives in
// host_tunables.go — here we route calls through the Daemon struct's
// priorTunables field so the same snapshot survives startup → commit →
// disable → shutdown.
//
// # Scope split (Codex round-2 fix)
//
// Two separate blast radii travel through this file:
//
//  1. Host-scope knobs (cpu-governor, netdev_budget): these touch
//     system-wide kernel state that every other workload on the host
//     shares. They MUST stay behind the `claim-host-tunables` opt-in
//     gate per the B1 finding — flipping the CPU governor or raising
//     netdev_budget silently would violate D3's "only touch what xpfd
//     owns" invariant.
//
//  2. Per-interface coalescence (ethtool -C adaptive / rx-usecs /
//     tx-usecs): this is interface-scoped — same blast radius as D3's
//     RSS indirection rewrite. The #801 Step-0 win (REV CoV
//     7.68%→1.5% on mlx5 adaptive-off) lives entirely in this knob.
//     It runs regardless of `claim-host-tunables` because the mlx5
//     interface is already inside xpfd's zone model, identified via
//     the same `UserspaceBoundLinuxInterfaces` allowlist D3 uses.
//
// Transition matrix for the host-scope knobs (opt_in = claim-host-tunables):
//
//	prior      new        action
//	-------    -------    ----------------------------------------------
//	false      false      no-op (never claimed)
//	false      true       capture + write
//	true       true       capture-if-not-already + write (reconcile)
//	true       false      restore (B2); drop restored captures, RETAIN
//	                      any whose write failed + stay active to retry
//	                      the debt next reconcile (#5114)
//	(shutdown) *          restore (if active) on daemon Stop
//
// Coalescence (interface-scoped) runs on every apply with the same
// allowlist, capturing its own pre-xpfd state for restore on explicit
// adaptive re-enable or daemon shutdown.

// applyStep0Tunables is the single wire point for #801 Step-0 host
// tunables. Called from Run() at startup and from applyConfig() on
// every commit. Handles three responsibilities:
//
//  1. Opt-in gate (B1): host-scope knobs + adaptive flip are only
//     applied when claim_host_tunables is true.
//  2. Snapshot + write (B2): on every apply while claimed, the
//     pre-xpfd value is captured before the first write so restore can
//     revert to the exact pre-xpfd string.
//  3. Restore-on-disable (B2): when claim flips true → false, every
//     captured value is written back. A field is dropped from the
//     snapshot only after its restore write SUCCEEDS; a failed write
//     retains the capture + keeps priorTunablesActive true so the next
//     reconcile retries it (#5114 retry-debt invariant).
//
// Never returns an error — any failure logs and continues. Tunable
// regressions must not block commit or daemon start.

//   - Coalescence (interface-scoped): always runs for userspace-dp
//     mlx5 interfaces on the `rssAllowed` allowlist, regardless of
//     `claimHostTunables`. The mlx5 adaptive-off win is the headline
//     #801 result and defaulting it off behind an opt-in gate would
//     disable it for everyone who doesn't also opt into the
//     host-scope knobs. Coalescence captures its own pre-xpfd state
//     into `d.priorTunables.mlx5Adaptive` so shutdown-restore still
//     reverts the interfaces xpfd touched.
//
//   - Host-scope knobs (cpu-governor, netdev_budget): gated by
//     `claimHostTunables` per the B1 finding. Same state machine as
//     before — capture/write on first claim, restore-on-disable when
//     the opt-in flips back off.
