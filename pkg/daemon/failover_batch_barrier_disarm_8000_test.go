// #8000, daemon half: a superseded member must not leave its fence barrier
// armed.
//
// #9036 CHANGED THE MECHANISM AND KEPT THE GOAL. #8000 achieved "no misleading
// fence timeout" by DISARMING the barrier, which makes waitFailoverActuated
// take its `b == nil` arm and return nil — indistinguishable from a real
// fence, so a request that demoted NOTHING was ACKed `applied` and the peer
// promoted into the two-owner window #5640 exists to prevent. The barrier is
// now RESOLVED with cluster.ErrFailoverSuperseded instead: it still returns
// immediately (the assertion #8000 actually bought), and it now carries the
// reason, so the ack downgrades to failed and the operator is told the truth
// rather than a fence timeout.
//
// The cells below therefore assert PROMPT + SUPERSEDED, not PROMPT + nil. The
// timing assertion is #8000's and is kept verbatim; dropping it would hand back
// what #8000 bought while claiming to fix something else.
//
// The two halves of #8000 are one fix. Reporting the partial outcome (the
// pkg/cluster half) still leaves the applied-ack burning the full fence timeout
// on whichever member a concurrent reset claimed, and then reporting
// "timed out waiting for local fence actuation of redundancy group N" — a real
// error, naming the right RG, blaming the wrong subsystem. Nothing will ever
// actuate that barrier: a supersede enqueues NO demotion event, so there is no
// edge for watchClusterEvents to fence.
//
// These cells drive the INSTALLED closure (ss.OnRemoteFailoverBatch /
// ss.OnRemoteFailover), not disarmFailoverActuation directly. Calling the
// primitive would pass against a build where the wiring never calls it, which
// is the whole defect.
