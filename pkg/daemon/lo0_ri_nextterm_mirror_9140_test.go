// #9140 mirror guard. A term carrying BOTH `then routing-instance <x>` and
// `then next term` is now rejected at commit
// (validateFilterTerminalConflictStrict, pkg/config), but the TOLERANT load /
// peer-sync path downgrades that gate to a warning (#1960 no-brick), so the
// shape can still reach this renderer from an already-persisted or peer-synced
// config. This cell pins what the renderer does with it, and — more
// importantly — pins that it AGREES with the Rust evaluator.
//
// Both runtimes terminate the term as accept:
//
//   - Rust: `continue_term: snap.action.is_empty() && snap.routing_instance.is_empty()`
//     (userspace-dp/src/filter/compiler.rs) is FALSE when the routing-instance
//     is set — even with next_term set — and `resolve_term_action` maps the
//     empty action to FilterAction::Accept.
//   - Go nft mirror: the fall-through arm in nftRulesFromTerm is guarded by
//     `term.RoutingInstance == ""`, so the term falls to the terminating
//     switch and renders `accept`.
//
// The external review that produced #9140 proposed "fixing" the Go side alone,
// to `if term.NextTerm || (term.Action == "" && term.RoutingInstance == "")`.
// That would make nft fall through while the Rust evaluator still terminates —
// a kernel-vs-userspace divergence on a shape the tolerant path can still
// deliver, contradicting the mirror contract stated in
// daemon_nft_term_lower.go. If the semantics are ever changed deliberately,
// BOTH sides move together and this cell is updated with them; it going red on
// a one-sided edit is the point.
