// #5103: the AF_XDP worker join must happen BEFORE the RETH MAC link DOWN/UP,
// not after it.
//
// PrepareLinkCycle's contract is that no thread touches UMEM once it returns,
// so it has to precede the NIC queue/link teardown. The daemon used to call
// programRethMAC first and only join workers afterwards, once it saw
// linkCycled=true — its own comment conceded the workers "may have been
// accessing UMEM during the DOWN/UP". A same-plan apply with defer_workers does
// not stop already-running workers, so the barrier really did land after the
// transition.
//
// The join cannot simply be hoisted above programRethMAC: whether a cycle is
// needed at all is only knowable by ATTEMPTING the live MAC set, and joining
// workers unconditionally would pay a forwarding outage on every apply for the
// drivers (mlx5, virtio) that support IFF_LIVE_ADDR_CHANGE and need no cycle.
// So the join is a hook invoked on the fallback path only, after the live set
// has failed and before the first mutation.

// recordingRethOps is a fake netlink seam that records the ORDER of the link
// operations, so the test asserts a sequence rather than a set.

// The daemon's ONE link-cycle lease acquisition is written inside the
// beforeCycle closure in programRethMACWithWorkerJoin, and what keeps that lease
// inside applyDataplaneAndHACore's deferred abandonLinkCycleLease is not where
// the call is WRITTEN — it is that programRethMAC INVOKES the callback
// synchronously. The static guard
// (pkg/dataplane/userspace/link_cycle_acquisition_site_6871_test.go) marks that
// site "[in a func literal]" precisely because no AST fact establishes this, and
// its linkCycleUnprovenFormBindings map names THIS test as the substitute. Do
// not rename it without updating that entry — the map checks the name exists.
//
// The assertion is goroutine identity, which is the strongest available form: a
// hook body that executes on the caller's goroutine necessarily runs inside the
// dynamic extent of the programRethMAC call, so it has completed before
// programRethMAC returns and therefore before programRethMACWithWorkerJoin does.
//
// It is deliberately STRICTER than the property strictly required. A hook
// dispatched to another goroutine and then joined before returning would also be
// contained, and would fail here. That is the wanted direction: it would be a
// real change to the containment argument, and it should have to be re-argued
// rather than pass silently.
//
// A hook that ran on another goroutine WITHOUT being joined fails in two ways
// and neither is a pass: unsynchronised writes to `ran`/`hookGoID` are a data
// race that -race reports, and without -race the reads most likely see the zero
