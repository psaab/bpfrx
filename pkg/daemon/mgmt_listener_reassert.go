// mgmt_listener_reassert.go — #6803.
//
// An unexpected management-listener serve exit was OBSERVABLE and never
// RECONCILED. Observable: the leg is marked dead, EffectiveHTTPAddr stops
// reporting it, and `show system services` renders the HTTP listener Failed.
// Never reconciled: the only caller of reconcileWebManagement is
// applyConfigLocked (daemon_apply.go), so the endpoint came back only when an
// operator happened to commit — on a box whose management API had just died,
// which is the box they can no longer reach to commit from.
//
// Two separate gaps had to close for a re-bind to be possible at all, both of
// them asymmetries with the HTTPS leg that #6827 round 6 had already fixed:
//
//   - api.Server.ReconcileHTTP short-circuited on a same-address leg WITHOUT
//     asking whether it was still serving, so even a forced re-drive returned
//     nil having done nothing. ReconcileHTTPS asks.
//   - managementReconciler.reconcileTo gated the HTTP rebind on the converged
//     FINGERPRINT alone. The fingerprint records what the last successful
//     reconcile bound; it is not evidence the socket is up.
//
// This file adds the third piece: an owner that notices. It mirrors
// proxyARPReassertLoop / raDeadSenderReassertLoop (#6793) /
// fabricIPVLANReassertLoop (#6791) / hostInboundConntrackReassertLoop (#6802) —
// started unconditionally in Run, cheap gate, applySem before acting.

// mgmtListenerReassertInterval is the cadence of the #6803 owner. A dead
// management listener is how an operator gets back IN, so recovery wants to be
// prompt; but the re-drive is a full management reconcile (a bind, and possibly
// a TLS load), so it must not run at the 2s cadence of the cluster reconcile.
// 30s matches the other always-on self-heal loops.
var mgmtListenerReassertInterval = 30 * time.Second

// mgmtReassertApply is the reconcile seam for the #6803 owner, in the same
// spirit as conntrackDeleteFilters and nftApplyPayload: a package var so a test
// can observe WHETHER the owner re-drove a reconcile, not merely what the
// listener ended up as. Production code must never mutate it.
//
// It exists because the re-drive is IDEMPOTENT. Asking "was the listener rebound"
// cannot distinguish an owner that correctly skipped a redundant reconcile from
// one that ran a full reconcile for nothing — a reconcile against an
// already-healthy leg changes no listener, so the #4001 inside-the-semaphore
// re-check was invisible to an outcome-shaped assertion and survived its
// mutation cell. The call itself is the observable.

			// that already had a second problem.
			//
			// This loop is the right host rather than a new one — it is

// It takes applySem before acting, for the #4001 reason the sibling loops give:
// an apply may be mid-flight, and reconciling the management listener against a
// half-applied configuration could bind an endpoint the in-flight apply is about
// to move. The gate is re-checked INSIDE the semaphore because the commit this
// tick queued behind may have rebound the listener already — re-driving then is
// a redundant bind on a healthy socket.
//
// The reconcile is driven from the ACTIVE config, not a snapshot taken before
// the wait, so a tick that blocked behind a commit converges on what that commit
// committed rather than on what was live when the tick started. reconcileTo's
// own committedDesired fence (#5561 round 14) makes that the same answer, and
// passing the active config keeps the two agreeing rather than relying on it.
