// #9348: filterDHCPConfigForMasterRGs reconstructed its result field by field
//
//	var result config.DHCPServerConfig
//	result.DHCPLocalServer = &config.DHCPLocalServerConfig{Groups: filtered}
//
// which names exactly the fields the author knew about and silently drops the
// rest. Measured before the fix — SIX fields, not the two the issue was filed
// with:
//
//	v4 SocketType    src="udp" filtered=""
//	v4 ExpiredLeases src=true  filtered=false
//	v6 SocketType    src="udp" filtered=""
//	v6 ExpiredLeases src=true  filtered=false
//	DynamicDNS       src=true  filtered=false
//	DynamicDNSv6     src=true  filtered=false
//
// The two that MATTER are the family-level Kea scalars: a CLUSTERED node
// rendered Kea without the operator's `expired-leases-processing` (#1387 — Kea
// fell back to its built-in reclamation defaults) and without
// `dhcp-socket-type` (#7318 — Kea fell back to `raw`), while a STANDALONE node
// rendered both from the same committed config. #7318 exists because `raw` does
// not work on some substrates, so on a cluster that leaf read as applied and was
// not.
//
// The DDNS pair is harmless, and that was CHECKED rather than assumed: this
// result reaches only dhcpserver.Manager (the Kea render), and the DDNS policy
// is read straight off the ACTIVE config by
// ddns.Manager.ReconcileScoped(ctx, &cfg.System.DHCPServer, opts). pkg/dhcpserver
// never reads DynamicDNS at all.
//
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: restore the field-by-field construction and every cell here
// goes RED.
