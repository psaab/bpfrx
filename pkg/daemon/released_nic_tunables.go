// Released-NIC tuning teardown (#6801).
//
// # The ownership hole this closes
//
// Two per-interface tuning knobs are applied to the mlx5 NICs that the
// userspace dataplane binds AF_XDP on — the D3 RSS indirection table
// (rss_indirection.go) and interrupt coalescence (coalescence.go). Both
// derive their target set from ONE allowlist,
// dpuserspace.UserspaceBoundLinuxInterfaces(cfg), recomputed from the
// *new* compiled config on every reconcile.
//
// That made both reconcilers blind to a SHRINKING allowlist. With config
// A binding {ge-0-0-1, ge-0-0-2} and config B binding only {ge-0-0-1},
// every loop walks the new set — so ge-0-0-2 kept xpf's concentrated RSS
// table and its adaptive-off / pinned-usecs coalescence even though xpf
// no longer owned it. The coalescence capture was restored only at daemon
// shutdown; the RSS table was never restored at all. A NIC handed back to
// the host stack (or to another dataplane) stayed limited to the old
// AF_XDP queue subset with latency-oriented coalescence until xpfd
// stopped or an operator ran ethtool by hand.
//
// # The invariant
//
// Every host/NIC mutation must be reverted when the interface leaves xpf
// ownership — not only when the process exits. This file implements that
// as a level-triggered `owned - current` teardown:
//
//	release: for each iface in owned but NOT in the current allowlist,
//	         restore the default RSS indirection table and the captured
//	         pre-xpfd coalescence, then drop ownership.
//	claim:   union the current allowlist's mlx5 members into the owned
//	         set (claim-before-touch; see claimNICTunableOwnership).
//
// The released and retained sets are disjoint by construction, so the
// release is order-independent with respect to both the claim and the
// re-apply. It is placed first anyway, mirroring the managed->unmapped
// teardown that pkg/daemon/device_map.go runs before networkd.Apply: a
// NIC leaving xpf's ownership is handed back before xpf spends
// bounded-but-real ethtool round-trips on the set it keeps.
//
// # Why an EMPTY allowlist is not, by itself, a withdrawal
//
// UserspaceBoundLinuxInterfaces degrades to nil when its snapshot build
// fails (see its #2514 comment), and applyTailReconciles still runs the
// tunable step on a commit whose dataplane apply failed. Treating "no
// names" as "release everything" would therefore let a transient
// derivation error rip xpf's tuning off NICs the dataplane is still
// forwarding on — and `ethtool -X ... default` mid-traffic re-steers
// in-flight flows onto different RX queues. So the withdrawal trigger is
// the CONFIG signal (`userspaceDP == false`, a pure config read with no
// error path), never an empty list. With userspace-dp still enabled and
// an empty list, ownership is retained untouched — the same refusal to
// act on an empty allowlist that applyRSSIndirection and applyCoalescence
// already make.
//
// # Retry debt (#5114 shape)
//
// Ownership is dropped only after the restore write SUCCEEDS. A failed
// `ethtool -X`/`-C` keeps the interface in the owned/capture map, so the
// next reconcile recomputes the same released set and retries. No timer
// is needed: the release is driven purely by `owned - current`, and a
// released name stays outside the allowlist until it is re-bound.
//
// # Interface disappearance
//
// If a released name is no longer an mlx5 netdev — unplugged, renamed by
// a .link change, or rebound to another driver — the tuning went with it
// (a driver rebind resets ring and coalescence configuration). Ownership
// is dropped WITHOUT an ethtool call: that both honors the Codex H1
// invariant (never invoke ethtool on a non-mlx5 netdev) and stops the
// retry debt from growing without bound on a NIC that can never accept
// the restore.

// claimNICTunableOwnership records every mlx5 member of the current

//
// The claim is CONFIG-derived, not touch-derived, and is deliberately a
// superset of "reprogrammed this reconcile":
//
//   - It is claim-before-touch. An apply that dies partway through still
//     leaves the NIC owned, so the next reconcile can hand it back.
//   - Over-claiming costs at most one extra `ethtool -X <iface> default`
//     on release. That call is idempotent and is exactly what the
//     rss-indirection kill switch already issues on exactly this set, so
//     it can never leave the NIC in a worse state.
//   - Under-claiming is the actual defect (#6801): a NIC whose table xpf
//     concentrated but did not record is never handed back.
//
// It is a UNION, not a replacement: releaseUnboundNICTunables has already
// removed the names it restored and kept the names whose restore failed,
// and that retry debt must survive the claim.
