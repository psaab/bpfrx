// #9135: dhcpRouteVRFMap is the PRODUCER side of the #8963 remedy, and it keyed
// on the routing instance's `interface` list VERBATIM — i.e. the Junos SLASH
// spelling the compiler stores (`ge-0/0/1.0`). The CONSUMER looks the map up by
// `lease.Interface`, which is `config.DHCPLeaseIfName` = LinuxIfName, i.e. the
// DASH spelling (`ge-0-0-1`). So the #8963 fix was INERT for the canonical Junos
// spelling: every VRF-attached DHCP route fell back to `vrf == ""` and was
// emitted in the DEFAULT context — precisely the behaviour #8963 was filed
// against.
//
// WHY THE #8963 TEST DID NOT SEE THIS: it lives in pkg/frr and hand-builds
// `frr.DHCPRoute{VRF: "vrf1"}` literals, so it exercises the RENDERER with the
// map's answer already supplied. The map is upstream of its first line. The
// fixture's shape is the reason the defect survived the fix, so these cells
// drive collectDHCPRoutes — the real producer/consumer pair — and never
// construct a DHCPRoute.
