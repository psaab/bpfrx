// rg_ownership_8297.go carries a THREE-state ownership answer for consumers
// whose safe fail direction is "act" rather than "stay silent".
//
// #8342 is the reason this exists. #8314 gated proxy-ARP on
// `isRethMasterState` -> `AllVRRPMaster()` -> `allMasterLocked()`, which
// returns FALSE when the RG has no known VRRP instances:
//
//	if len(s.vrrpInstances) == 0 { return false }
//
// For the DHCP relay that predicate was written for, "nothing known -> do not
// relay" avoids a duplicate and failing closed is right. For proxy-ARP it is an
// OUTAGE: the entry is not installed, nobody answers for the address, and every
// NAT pool / DNAT / static-NAT external address on that segment goes dark. The
// revert measured exactly that — `fw0=0 fw1=0`, empty on both nodes.
//
// **A predicate's fail DIRECTION belongs to its consumer, not to its name.**
// That sentence is #8342's, and this file is what it asks for: the two-state
// bool cannot express the difference between "we are not the owner" and "we do
// not know who is", and proxy-ARP must treat those oppositely.
//
// Proxy ARP for NAT is a shipped, High-priority feature (`docs/feature-gaps.md`)
// — "Required when SNAT pool, DNAT, or static-NAT external addresses are on same
// L2 segment" — so silence is never the safe default for it. Answering twice is
// a defect (#8297); answering zero times is a bigger one.

// rgOwnership is a three-state answer to "does this node own redundancy-group
// N?", kept distinct from a bool so a caller cannot silently collapse the
// unknown case into either verdict.

//
// #8640: this exists because the VRRP-derived `Ownership()` above answers
// `Unknown` as a STEADY STATE on a real cluster. `vrrpInstances` is populated
// from one place — VRRP state-change EVENTS (`daemon_ha.go:902`/`:930`, gated on
// `isRethVRRPEvent`) — and nothing seeds it from current state. Measured on the
// loss userspace cluster: `show chassis cluster status` reports
// `vrrp-master=none` for EVERY redundancy group while simultaneously reporting
// `node0 primary / node1 secondary`, and ten fresh ARP probes for a pool address
// were answered by BOTH nodes with their own per-node RETH virtual MACs. So
// `Unknown` there does not mean "ownership is unknowable"; it means "no VRRP
// event has reached that handler".
//
// `cluster.GroupState(rgID).State == StatePrimary` is the predicate
// `shouldOwnDirectVIPs` (daemon_ha_vip.go) already uses to decide whether this
// node ADDS the RG's VIPs — which is why node0 held 172.16.80.8 and node1 did
// not in that same measurement. Reading it here makes one invariant true:
//
//	a node answers proxy-ARP for an address on an interface exactly when it
//	holds that interface's VIPs
//
// because both questions now read the SAME predicate and therefore cannot
// disagree. A node that does not hold the address should not draw traffic for
// it; that is the whole of what #8297 was trying to express.

// did before this change. Suppressing on `Unknown` was considered and refused:
// it asks "do we KNOW who owns this?" and answers "no" permanently wherever the
// cache is empty, silencing every node — reinstating the very outage #8621
