// #8526 WIRING. runShutdownSequence must bound the dataplane control socket
// before it starts waiting on anything, because three of its waits can be held
// by a goroutine sitting in a control round trip whose reachable deadline is
// 67s against this unit's TimeoutStopSec=20.
//
// THE SILENT-FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. The bound is reached through an OPTIONAL
// interface (controlShutdownBounder), so a rename, a missing adapter
// pass-through, or a deleted call site produces no build error and no failing
// test anywhere else — the assertion just stops matching and the daemon
// quietly goes back to being SIGKILLed mid-shutdown. The two compile-time
// assertions below cover the type side; the test covers the call site and its
// ORDER.
//
// The daemon holds the userspace runtime as a *LegacyDataPlaneAdapter
// (userspace.Boot returns one), so the ADAPTER is the type that actually has
// to match. *Manager is asserted too because that is what the adapter forwards
// to, and a rename there is the other half of the same break.

// UpdatePolicyScheduleState, the site #8526 was filed against.
//
// The sequence can therefore only return promptly if BeginControlShutdown ran
// BEFORE d.stopPolicySchedulerLoop()'s unbounded schedulerWg.Wait(). That
// makes this an ORDER assertion, not just a call-count one.
