// daemon_goroutine_shutdown_5523_test.go — #5523 C179-093 regression coverage.
//
// Two more daemon background goroutines were NOT covered by the run WaitGroup
// and leaked at shutdown, so a late tick could run against a torn-down
// subsystem and (for the aggregator) the #5313 final flush was skipped:
//
//   - the session-aggregation flush goroutine (applyAggregator → agg.Run),
//     which binds to context.Background() and was cancelled only via aggCancel
//     on a config replace/disable — never at shutdown; and
//   - the IPsec DHCP-rebind retry loop (ipsecRebindRetryLoop), which bound
//     directly to d.daemonCtx (the raw background ctx, never cancelled in
//     production, #5807), so a 30s rebind tick could race teardown.
//
// The shutdown sequence now cancels + JOINS both (stopAggregator /
// stopIPsecRebindLoop) BEFORE the dependent subsystems are torn down, mirroring
// the #5308 stopPolicySchedulerLoop / stopPinRetryLoop. The stop helpers are
// exercised via joinWithin (defined in daemon_goroutine_shutdown_5308_test.go)
// so a revert turns the resulting hang into a fast t.Fatal (RED).
