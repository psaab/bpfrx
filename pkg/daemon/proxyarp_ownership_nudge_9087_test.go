// #9087, the second half: the reconcile was not driven by an RG OWNERSHIP
// CHANGE, only by a commit and a 30s ticker — and a failover is not a commit.
//
// So for up to proxyARPReassertInterval after a transition the new owner had
// not installed the proxy entry and the old owner had not swept it. Measured on
// the loss cluster right after a crash-failover plus manual failback:
// `fw0=0 fw1=1` — the only answerer being the node that no longer owns the
// address, which mis-steers pool-mode NAT return traffic for the window.
//
// These bind the WIRING, because the nudge helper on its own is not the fix:
// severing either call site restores the window while every unit test of the
// reconcile keeps passing. That is the shape that hid the first half of this
// issue for months.
