// Managed service-file reload debt (#6800).
//
// Two of the daemon's managed-file appliers converge an on-disk service
// configuration and then gate a RUNTIME reload on "did the file set actually
// change":
//
//   - applySyslogFiles     -> reconcileSyslogDropins  -> systemctl restart rsyslog
//   - applySystemNTP       -> reconcileManagedFile    -> chronyc reload sources /
//                                                        systemctl reload chrony
//   - applySSHConfig       -> remove the sshd drop-in -> systemctl reload sshd
//                             (the REMOVAL branch only — see below)
//
// The gate is correct for the steady state — it is what stops every commit from
// bouncing rsyslog — but before this change it also ERASED the debt created by a
// FAILED reload. The write half had already succeeded, so the files were
// converged; the reload half failed, was logged, and dropped. On the next apply
// the reconcile compared desired against the (already converged) on-disk set,
// reported `changed == false`, and skipped the reload. The running daemon kept
// serving the PREVIOUS ruleset — records still flowing to a removed syslog
// destination, or chrony still stepping to the old server set — for as long as
// the operator did not happen to make a FURTHER syslog/NTP edit. A reboot was
// the only reliable recovery, on a node that had reported a successful commit.
//
// The failure is not exotic: `systemctl restart rsyslog` fails whenever the unit
// is in a failed/masked state, whenever the transaction is refused because
// another job is queued on the unit, and whenever the 15s exec timeout expires
// on a loaded box. Each of those is transient — which is exactly why a retry
// owner recovers and a dropped error does not.
//
// The fix is the pattern this repo has settled on for "a failure has no retry
// owner" (proxyARPReassertLoop #4001, raDeadSenderReassertLoop #6793,
// fabricIPVLANReassertLoop #6791): a PERSISTENT debt recording the exact reload
// still owed, consulted by the next apply, plus an always-on re-assert loop
// started unconditionally in Run so recovery does not depend on an operator
// committing again.
//
// The debt retains the OWED REQUEST, not a re-derived one. That distinction is
// load-bearing for chrony, whose runtime reload has two INDEPENDENT legs: a
// sources reload (`chronyc reload sources`) and a threshold reload (`systemctl
// reload chrony`). If apply #1 fails the sources leg and apply #2 changes only
// the threshold file, re-deriving the request from apply #2's own change flags
// would run the threshold leg alone and silently drop the sources debt. Both
// call sites therefore fold the retained debt INTO the request they issue.
//
// sshd is the third instance and the one most easily missed, because half of it
// is already correct. applySSHConfig's UPDATE path reverts the drop-in to its
// prior content when the reload fails (#2062), so the file does NOT stay
// converged and the next apply rewrites-and-reloads on its own — that half has
// a retry owner. The REMOVAL path has nothing to revert TO: the drop-in is
// deleted, the reload then fails, and the next apply reads `hadDropIn == false`
// and returns before reaching a reload. sshd keeps enforcing the xpf policy the
// operator DELETED — a `PermitRootLogin`, cipher or MAC setting that may be more
// permissive than the base-image default — until a manual restart or a reboot.

// serviceReloadDebt is the retained "a runtime reload is still owed" record for
// the xpf-managed service configuration files. The zero value is "nothing
// owed", so a Daemon built as a struct literal (which is how most of this
// package's tests build one) needs no initialisation.
