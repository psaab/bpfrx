// #9237: a responder whose goroutine exited (the socket open failed) must be
// EVICTED and restarted, not treated as running forever.
//
// The entry is published before the socket opens, so a failure leaves a member
// that owns nothing — and the running branch then swaps the address snapshot
// rather than restarting, on reasoning that is correct only for a responder
// that IS running. Neither the apply path nor the 30s reassert owner could
// recover it.
//
// Drives syncProxyARPResponders directly: it is the reconcile's worker and
// holds BOTH the sweep and the running-branch the sweep has to beat, while
// reconcileProxyARP itself resolves interface names through netlink, which a
// unit test cannot reach. The reconcile -> sync wiring is already bound by
// TestReconcileProxyARPStopsResponderOnRemoval's stop path.
//
// RED ON REVERT: remove the eviction sweep and the dead entry survives every
// reconcile, with the startup log still saying "started".
