// #7074: the RETH abort rollback must rebind the dataplane instance whose
// workers it actually stopped, not whichever one happens to be published when
// the rollback runs.
//
// Since #6743 the dataplane is read through an atomic cell (`d.dataplane()`),
// not a plain field, so a bootstrap-exit publish can swap or clear it between
// the join and the rollback. `programRethMACWithWorkerJoin` therefore pins the
// joined instance in a local. Before this test nothing bound that pin: reverting
// it to a re-read (`d.dataplane().Link().NotifyLinkCycleKeepingLease()`) left
// `go test ./pkg/daemon/...` fully green — measured at 2f76a925e, rc=0, zero
// named failures.
//
// The window is real but narrow, which is why no existing test reaches it: it
// needs a republish DURING the beforeCycle hook. That is what `onPrepare` is
// for.
//
// What the re-read would do, and why it is worse than a nil-deref: the rollback
// exists to send "rebind" to undo the "stop_workers" the hook sent. Re-reading
// the cell can address that rebind to a DIFFERENT helper — one whose workers
// were never stopped — leaving the first instance mid-teardown with no owner
// (forwarding down on the node, the #5103 F4 outage) while the second is told to
// rebind sockets it never released.
