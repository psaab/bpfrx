// #8597 (muse-004 K23) — stopPolicySchedulerLoop acquired applySem with
// context.Background(), so a wedged apply stalled the whole orderly shutdown.
//
// daemon_run_shutdown.go states the rule at its own drain: "bound it
// defensively anyway so a wedged apply cannot block the whole shutdown past the
// drain budget." A census of applySem acquires reachable from the shutdown
// sequence finds exactly two — that drain, which was bounded, and this one,
// which was not. (stopPinRetryLoop, the sibling cleanup called on the next
// line, does not touch applySem at all.)
//
// What the stall costs: the scheduler is never cancelled, so shutdown never
// reaches the HA relinquish that follows, and systemd's TimeoutStopSec ends the
// process with SIGKILL — no rg_active clear, no priority-0 advert, no RA
// goodbye. A clean sub-second handover becomes a blackout.

// stopWithin runs stopPolicySchedulerLoop on a goroutine and waits at most
// budget for it.
//
// Every cell in this file that holds applySem MUST go through it. Under the
// mutation this file exists to catch, the call does not return at all — so a
// cell that invoked it inline would HANG rather than fail, and a hanging cell
// is a void: its mutant produces no verdict, only a timed-out package. The one
// cell that ran inline in the first draft did exactly that.
