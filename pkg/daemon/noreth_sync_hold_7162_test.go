// #7162: the bounded startup promotion hold for no-reth-vrrp /
// private-rg-election mode.
//
// RETH VRRP mode has suppressed startup preemption since #466
// (`vrrp.Manager.SetSyncHold`). These modes had no equivalent, so a node could
// promote an RG before bulk session sync delivered any conntrack/NAT state and
// reset every established flow.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS ARE GUARDING AGAINST, in both directions. The obvious
// under-fix is no hold at all. The dangerous OVER-fix is a continuous
// `cluster.IsSyncReady()` conjunct — which is what #110 measured and rejected,
// because `syncReady` has no bound while the sync channel is down and would
// block promotion INDEFINITELY in exactly the degraded-peer case preemption
// exists for. So there is a cell for the hold applying, a cell for each release
// edge, and a cell that the release does not depend on peer state.
