// #8438: `interface-range` expansion was uncapped and superlinear — 32,000
// members took 142 s at commit with zero diagnostic, on the strict path AND
// the tolerant peer-sync / boot path.
//
// The cost is driven by the PRODUCT of members and shared statements, because
// each shared statement is replayed through ConfigTree.SetPath under each
// member and SetPath finds the member by a linear scan of the `interfaces`
// root, which by then holds every member. Measured before the fix:
//
//	members  shared  compile
//	  2,000     1     0.4 s
//	  4,096     1     1.4 s
//	  4,096     3    23.2 s
//	  4,096     6    77.9 s
//	  2,000    20   268   s
//
// That table is why this is not a member-count cap. A 4096-MEMBER limit — the
// number the sibling `member-range` guard already ships, and the obvious fix —
// admits every row: 4,096 members with six shared statements is a 78-second
// commit it waves straight through.

// rangeBody8438 builds one interface-range with `members` members (spelled as
// a `member` list, or as repeated `member-range` statements when useRange is
// set) and `shared` shared statements.
