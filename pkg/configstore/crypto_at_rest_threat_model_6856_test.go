// #6856: pin the ACTUAL at-rest-encryption threat model, in both directions.
//
// `system master-password` is an encryption-POLICY knob, not a secret: the
// subtree is closed-world and carries exactly one leaf
// (`pseudorandom-function`), so no operator secret ever enters the config.
// The AES-GCM key is 32 random bytes in `.configdb/master.key`, written
// alongside the ciphertext it protects.
//
// That yields a guarantee much narrower than "the config is encrypted at
// rest", and the narrowness is the whole point of pkg/configstore/README.md's
// "What at-rest encryption does and does not protect" section. These cells
// bind the two facts that section asserts, so the documentation cannot drift
// away from the code silently:
//
//   - a COPY OF THE DIRECTORY decrypts, because the key travels with it; and
//   - a copy of the BODY ALONE does not.
//
// Deliberately a PAIRED cell. Either half alone proves only correlation: the
// body-only half would still pass if encryption were skipped entirely and the
// body were rejected for some unrelated reason, and the directory-copy half
// would still pass if nothing were ever encrypted. Together they show the key
// file is necessary AND sufficient — which is exactly the documented claim.
//
// If a future change binds the KDF to an operator secret, moves master.key
// outside the DB directory, or seals it to a TPM, the directory-copy half
// REDS. That is correct and intended: the security claim in the README would
// no longer be true, and it must be rewritten in the same change.
