// #8445 — a policer `then` carrying BOTH `discard` and a marking action keeps
// only the last one, and with `discard` written first the compiled policer
// METERS AND DROPS NOTHING. The rate limit the operator authored is entirely
// unenforced and the commit reports success.
//
// Measured before the gate was written, by dumping the compiled struct:
//
//	then { discard; loss-priority high; }  ThenAction "loss-priority high"
//	then { loss-priority high; discard; }  ThenAction "discard"
//
// Same intent, two behaviours, decided by SOURCE ORDER — and only one of them
// enforces anything. `filters.go` sets DiscardExcess only for "discard", and
// the Rust `build_single_rate_policer_state` then selects
// `ThreeColorTreatments::default()` (no drop) for everything else.
//
// These cells bind the gate at `CheckText`, the real operator commit path.
