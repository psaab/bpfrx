// #6924 — the `tunnel mode` allowlist rejects at COMMIT, and must not brick a
// box that already persisted an unrecognised mode (#1960).
//
// The two halves are one test each because they are two different call sites,
// the same argument ipip_no_brick_4785_test.go makes: the pkg/config tests
// drive SchemaValidate directly, which binds the validator and leaves the
// INGRESS unbound. A change that made Store.Load schema-validate would keep
// every pkg/config test green while a booting node lost its config over a
// tunnel that was already inert.
//
// PAIRED on the same fixture text, one axis:
//
//	strict commit-check -> REJECTED (the fix does something)
//	tolerant boot       -> ACCEPTED and PRESERVED (it does not brick)
//
// Without the first half a validator that accepted everything would satisfy the
// second; without the second, rejecting at the schema layer would be
// indistinguishable from rejecting everywhere, which is the #1960 brick.

// unknownModeConfig is a config an older binary would have committed green:
// `tunnel mode banana` was accepted by a schema leaf that had no validator.
