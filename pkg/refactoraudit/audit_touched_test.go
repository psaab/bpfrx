// This file holds the HARD half of the #7253 split: a file THE PR TOUCHES
// crossed a modularity threshold.
//
// The property it gates is local and non-perishable. Its verdict is a
// function of (the branch's changed set, each changed file's LOC at the
// merge base, its LOC in the working tree) and NOTHING else — in
// particular not docs/refactoring-audit-current.txt, which is a snapshot
// of a repo-global quantity that any unrelated file can invalidate. So a
// red here names a file the author grew, is reproducible from the
// branch's own diff, and stays true however many sibling PRs land in the
// meantime.
//
// The freshness half — "the committed global snapshot disagrees with the
// tree" — is demoted to TestGlobalHeatmapFreshnessAdvisory (reports, does
// not fail) plus scripts/refactoring-audit-refresh.sh (converges it
// without interrupting anyone). audit_canary_test.go carries the
// measurements that forced the split.

// touchedFile is one audit-eligible path the branch changed, with its LOC
// on both sides of the branch's merge base. It is the parsed form of one
// scripts/refactoring-audit-touched.sh row.
type touchedFile struct {
	path    string
	baseLOC int  // LOC at the merge base; meaningless when isNew
	headLOC int  // LOC in the working tree
	isNew   bool // the branch added the file (absent at the merge base)
}

// thresholdCrossings is the gate's whole decision, as a pure function.
//
// A file crosses when it was BELOW a floor at the branch's merge base and
// is AT OR ABOVE it in the working tree. Both halves matter and each is
// load-bearing in the opposite direction:
//
//   - dropping the base test turns this into "you touched a big file",
//     which reds every PR that edits one line of an existing 2400-line
//     module — the file did not grow past anything, and its author cannot
//     act on the news;
//   - dropping the head test turns it into "you touched a file", full
//     stop.
//
// A file added by the branch is measured from 0, so a new 1600-line file
// crosses (that is the tcp_segmentation.rs case, which was a correct and
// useful catch and is deliberately kept).
//
// Only the HIGHEST floor crossed is reported: 1400 -> 2100 is a
// [REFACTOR] crossing, not a [WATCH] crossing plus a [REFACTOR] one.
// Growth WITHIN a band is not a crossing — "adds >100 LOC to a
// [REFACTOR]-tier file: split before landing" is a real project rule
// (docs/refactoring-audit.md) but it is a review judgement, not this
// gate's business, and #7253 is explicitly about not interrupting people
// with things they cannot act on.

//	gate is not a snapshot compare AND is not implied by one.
//
//	world B: the committed snapshot is perfectly fresh, and the branch
//	grew a file it touches across a floor with the artifact already
//	recording the new tier. Snapshot compare: GREEN. Touched gate: RED.
//	=> the touched gate is not derivable from any snapshot compare, not
//	even a restricted one: there is no drift to restrict.
//
// World B is the decisive half. A snapshot compare cannot produce that
// red at all, because the artifact and the tree agree; only the branch's
