// step8_iperf_port_test.go — #7610.
//
// `docs/engineering-style.md` step 8 tells every lane to apply
// `test/incus/cos-iperf-config.set` and then measure throughput on a specific
// port against a ≥ 23 Gbit/s bar. In that fixture THE PORT IS THE CLASS: the
// `bandwidth-output` filter maps each of 5200-5211 to a different
// forwarding-class, and several of those classes are shaped.
//
// The doc named 5203, which maps to `iperf-3g` → `scheduler-3g`,
// `transmit-rate 3.0g exact`. So the instruction was "shape this traffic to
// 3 Gb/s, then fail the change if it does not reach 23" — a lane following it
// literally reads a correctly working shaper as an 8x regression. The
// "no regression vs previous run" clause made it worse, not better: every
// previous run of the same wrong port also reported ~3 Gbit/s, so the reading
// looked corroborated.
//
// This gate binds the AGREEMENT between the two files rather than pinning
// either to a literal. Pinning the doc to "5211" would encode which side I
// trust; if someone renumbers the fixture, a literal-pinned test keeps passing
// while the doc goes wrong again. The invariant is "the port step 8 names must
// resolve, IN THE FIXTURE, to an unshaped class" — which stays true under a
// renumber.
