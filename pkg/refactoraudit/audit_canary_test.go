// TestGlobalHeatmapFreshnessAdvisory reports global snapshot drift and

//
// # Why the fatal came off
//
// TestHeatmapNotStale fused two different properties into one assertion:
//
//	modularity — "this file is growing past the point where it should be
//	split". Aimed at the author of the growth, actionable by them, and
//	worth interrupting them for.
//
//	freshness — "the committed global snapshot disagrees with the tree".
//	Aimed at whoever merges next, not actionable by them, and not worth
//	interrupting anyone for.
//
// Only the first is a gate. The second could not even stay true between
// authoring and merge: the artifact is a snapshot of a repo-GLOBAL
// property, so any file crossing 1500 or 2000 LOC anywhere in the tree
// flips it for everyone. #7235, #7252 and #7254 each regenerated it
// inside one hour for different files, and #7252 was ALREADY STALE when
// it merged — it was merged, master re-tested, and was still red on the
// same two files. A PR whose entire content was "make the artifact match
// the tree" could not survive its own review latency.
//
// #6617 had already narrowed this class once, byte-compare ->
// content-compare, after measuring master byte-stale in 26 of 40
// first-parent commits and after #6602 and #6613 both regenerated at
// their own base and both still landed red on pkg/snmp/agent.go, a file
// neither had touched. (Precise sequence, preserved from that comment:
// #6602 regenerated at 1737 LOC in b5a524b2e, and its sync merge
// aac0d60dd then incorporated #6596's 1823-line file WITHOUT refreshing
// the artifact. The 26-of-40 count is over the first-parent commits
// ending at b4605ea9d and is reproducible by regenerating at each one.)
// Its own comment states the principle this test now obeys: a gate that
// reds when the author did everything right is noise. The content compare was a real improvement but kept the shape;
// pkg/dataplane/types.go crossing the floor at exactly 1501 lines flipped
// the gate for every unrelated author on the board.
//
// The modularity signal is NOT deleted — tcp_segmentation.rs entering the
// audit at 1582 was a correct and useful catch. It moved to
// TestTouchedFileCrossedModularityThreshold, which derives its verdict
// from the PR's own diff and therefore cannot be invalidated by an
// unrelated file. Global freshness converges through
// scripts/refactoring-audit-refresh.sh instead of through a human.
//
// # What still has teeth here
//
// Staleness does not fail. Corruption does: parseHeatmap is fail-closed,
// so a malformed committed artifact, a malformed generation, or a
// generator that emits nothing at all is still a hard failure on both
// sides of this compare. The advisory part is the DIFFERENCE between two
