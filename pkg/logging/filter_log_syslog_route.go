// filter_log_syslog_route.go — #6859: which firewall-filter terms may reach the
// syslog clients.
//
// Junos routes the two filter-log actions to different sinks: `then log` writes
// the filter-log buffer, `then syslog` sends to the system log. xpf categorised
// every filter-log event as CategoryFirewall and gated the fan-out only per
// CLIENT, never per term — so both spellings reached every subscribed syslog
// client, and a term an operator wrote as `then log` specifically to keep hits
// ON the box was shipped to whatever remote collector was configured.
//
// THE DECISION CANNOT BE MADE IN THE DATAPLANE. The `syslog` bit reaches the
// Rust FirewallTermSnapshot (#6853) but parse_term never consumes it, so the
// event carries no indication of which spelling produced it. What it DOES carry
// is RuleID/TermID, and the Rust side assigns both as positional indices into
// the snapshot the Go control plane itself rendered — so the control plane can
// answer authoritatively from the same snapshot it sent.
// userspace.FilterTermSyslogMap is a projection of that snapshot rather than a
// second walk of the config, because a divergence between the two orderings
// would route one term's hits under another term's spelling with nothing
// failing.
//
// PLACEMENT is what makes suppression safe: the gate is consulted at the syslog
// fan-out in ringbuf.go, AFTER the event-buffer callbacks and the daemon log
// line and BEFORE the local-writer loop. xpf has no `show firewall log`;
// `show security log` reads that buffer and still shows a suppressed hit.

// filterSyslogRoute holds the (filter_id, term_id) -> `then syslog` map the
// filter-log fan-out gate consults.
//
// The zero value is the pre-#6859 behaviour: a nil map means "no apply has
// wired this yet" and every filter-log event forwards, so a path that never
// wires it cannot silently suppress `then syslog` as well. An empty NON-nil map
// is the opposite instruction — "wired; this config has no `then syslog`
// terms" — and is what a config with all filters removed installs, so the
// reader cannot resume forwarding under deleted terms' ids.

//
// It is the SINGLE definition of that packing. The producer

// divergence would route filter-log events to the wrong sink with nothing
// failing — so the producer calls this function rather than repeating the

//
// Passing a nil map restores the pre-#6859 behaviour of forwarding every
// filter-log event to every syslog client. Callers wiring a real config should
// pass the projection even when it is empty (a config with no filter terms
// yields an empty NON-nil map), so the gate stays active.

// A COUNT would be the wrong instrument here and is deliberately not what this
// exposes: nil ("never wired", legacy fan-out) and an empty non-nil map
// ("wired, no syslog terms") both have length zero while instructing the gate
// to do OPPOSITE things, and a caller checking a count could not tell a wiring
// regression from a config with no `then syslog` terms. Returning the map makes
// both observable — the same reason SyslogClients exists alongside
// SyslogClientCount (#6829 F2).
