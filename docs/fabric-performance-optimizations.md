# Fabric Forwarding Performance Optimizations

## Current State (2026-04-04)

| Path | -P1 | -P8 |
|------|-----|-----|
| Direct (all RGs same node) | 7.8 Gbps | 23.0 Gbps |
| Fabric (split-RG) | 2.0 Gbps | 3.5 Gbps |

## Architecture: How Fabric Redirect Works Today

In strict userspace mode, steady-state fabric transit stays on the AF_XDP
dataplane. It does not rely on `PASS_TO_KERNEL` to bounce transit packets back
into the eBPF forwarding pipeline.

1. The XDP shim classifies packets and redirects transit session hits and
   misses to AF_XDP/userspace.
2. `PASS_TO_KERNEL` is reserved for local-delivery or explicit fallback cases:
   peer-synced local-delivery sessions, ESP, non-native GRE, NDP, and similar
   control-plane traffic.
3. The userspace helper resolves policy, NAT, routing, and HA ownership. If the
   result is `FabricRedirect`, the helper builds the fabric frame itself and
   transmits it through AF_XDP TX.
4. `publish_live_session_entry()` keeps subsequent transit packets on the
   userspace dataplane, so the hot path is flow cache plus `RewriteDescriptor`,
   not `PASS_TO_KERNEL`.
5. `apply_nat_on_fabric` decides whether the userspace helper should NAT the
   packet before fabric TX or preserve the original tuple for later handling on
   the owner side.

### Key implications

- Fabric NAT performance is still a userspace dataplane problem.
- The generic builders and segmentation path still pay real checksum work when
  the descriptor fast path cannot be used.
- Plans that assume "write `PASS_TO_KERNEL` earlier" are solving the wrong path
  for strict userspace fabric transit.

## Fabric NAT Flow (via Userspace Dataplane)

### Outbound: Client -> Server (split-RG: fw0=LAN, fw1=WAN)

```
Client 10.0.61.102:43446 -> 172.16.80.200:5201

1. Arrives on ge-0-0-1 (fw0, LAN)
2. XDP shim -> XSK redirect -> Rust worker
3. Session lookup -> FabricRedirect (RG1/WAN owned by fw1)
4. Rust helper: rewrite MACs for fabric link
   + apply_nat_on_fabric=true -> SNAT (src 10.0.61.102 -> 172.16.80.8)
   + recompute_l4_checksum_ipv4 (full payload walk)
5. TX out ge-0-0-0 (fabric parent, copy-mode XSK -> SKB -> virtio TX)
6. Arrives at fw1 ge-7-0-0 (fabric parent)
7. XDP shim -> XSK redirect -> Rust worker
8. Session lookup -> Forward (RG1/WAN is local)
9. Forwards out ge-7-0-2 (WAN) with src=172.16.80.8:43446
```

### Return: Server -> Client

```
Server 172.16.80.200:5201 -> 172.16.80.8:43446

1. Arrives on ge-7-0-2 (fw1, WAN)
2. XDP shim -> XSK redirect -> Rust worker
3. Session lookup -> FabricRedirect (RG2/LAN owned by fw0)
4. Rust helper: rewrite MACs for fabric link
   + apply_nat_on_fabric=true -> un-SNAT (dst 172.16.80.8 -> 10.0.61.102)
   + recompute_l4_checksum_ipv4 (full payload walk)
5. TX out ge-7-0-0 (fabric parent, copy-mode XSK -> SKB -> virtio TX)
6. Arrives at fw0 ge-0-0-0 (fabric parent)
7. XDP shim -> XSK redirect -> Rust worker
8. Session lookup -> Forward (RG2/LAN is local)
9. Forwards out ge-0-0-1 (LAN) with dst=10.0.61.102:43446
```

## Where the NAT Cost Still Lives

- `build_forwarded_frame_into_from_frame()` still falls back to
  `recompute_l4_checksum_ipv4` for IPv4 NAT plus port-enforcement cases on the
  generic path.
- `segment_forwarded_tcp_frames_from_frame()` has to rebuild TCP checksums per
  segment.
- Cache hits still recompute the fabric target binding lookup even though the
  descriptor structure already has space to cache it.

## Actual Bottleneck: Virtio Bridge Throughput

The fabric path runs at 3.5 Gbps with CPUs mostly idle (~2% peak in profiles).
This is NOT a CPU bottleneck — it's the virtio-net bridge throughput between VMs.

### Contributing factors

1. **Copy-mode XSK on virtio**: The fabric parent uses generic/copy-mode XSK
   (`__xsk_generic_xmit`). Every TX frame allocates an `sk_buff` and copies
   data — there is no zero-copy DMA path on virtio-net.

2. **Virtio TX ring size**: Limited to 256 entries (TX max on QEMU). At high pps,
   the ring fills and the VM must wait for completions before sending more.

3. **Bridge forwarding overhead**: The local bridge between VMs adds per-packet
   overhead for MAC learning, flooding, and sk_buff management.

4. **VM configuration**: vhost-net, NUMA pinning, multiqueue alignment, and CPU
   model settings affect VM-to-VM throughput.

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: VM-Level Tuning [LOW effort, potentially HIGH impact]

These are configuration changes, no code required:

1. Verify `vhost-net` is active on the host for both VMs.
2. Pin both VMs to the same NUMA node.
3. Set CPU model to `host` to expose AVX/AES-NI instructions.
4. Increase the virtio TX ring if QEMU supports it.
5. Test MTU 9000 on the bridge itself, not just on the VM interfaces.
6. Disable GSO/LRO inside the guest on the fabric parent if they are adding
   overhead in the pure-virtual path.

Expected improvement: 2-3x if the current ceiling is configuration, not
hardware.

### Phase 2: Tighten the Userspace Fabric/NAT Fast Path [MEDIUM effort]

1. Honor cached `apply_nat_on_fabric` decisions on `FabricRedirect` hits.
   Cached self-target and cross-binding hits must reuse the stored decision
   instead of forcing NAT back on. [COMPLETED — PR #435]
2. Replace the generic IPv4 full recompute path with a combined incremental
   NAT plus expected-port checksum update in
   `build_forwarded_frame_into_from_frame()`. [COMPLETED — incremental checksum
   for non-segmented fabric forwarding, commit `927bfe6f`]
3. Populate `RewriteDescriptor.target_binding_index` for cacheable fabric flows
   so hot hits can skip `fabric_target_index()` while config and FIB generation
   still match.
4. Measure how often `apply_rewrite_descriptor()` falls back to the generic
   builder because of port repair or cross-binding conditions, then widen
   descriptor coverage only where that fallback rate justifies the added code.

### Phase 3: Flow Cache HA Validity Check [COMPLETED — PR #432]

The `cached_flow_decision_valid()` per-packet HA check (1.3% CPU on the direct
path) has been replaced by an inline lease-expiry check in the flow cache stamp.
The `owner_rg_lease_until` field in each flow cache entry is compared against
the current timestamp — O(1) with no BTreeMap lookup. Same correctness
guarantees, better cache locality.

### Phase 4: Reduce Virtio Copy Overhead [LOW effort]

Profile and micro-optimize the copy-mode XSK TX path:

1. **Profile `__xsk_generic_xmit`** during fabric -P8 to find hot spots
2. **Batch TX submissions**: Ensure the Rust helper batches multiple frames
   per `sendto()` syscall to amortize kernel entry/exit overhead
3. **Investigate `XDP_ZEROCOPY`**: Check if virtio-net supports zerocopy mode
   in newer kernels (unlikely on QEMU/KVM, but worth checking)

### Phase 5: Re-profile After Fast-Path Cleanup [LOW effort]

1. Re-run split-RG perf after the Phase 2 and 3 userspace fixes.
2. Determine whether the remaining ceiling is virtio bridge throughput, TX
   completion pressure, binding lookup, or segmentation.
3. Only then decide whether more eBPF-side or VM-side work is worth it.

## Profile Data (Split-RG -P8)

### System-wide (mostly idle)

```
2.0%  pv_native_safe_halt       — CPU idle
1.7%  __irqentry_text_start     — interrupt handling
1.4%  scanobject                — Go GC (daemon, not dataplane)
1.2%  __raw_callee_save_spin    — kernel spinlock
1.2%  worker_loop               — Rust worker (mostly idle)
1.2%  mlx5e_napi_poll           — NIC polling
1.1%  mlx5e_poll_xdpsq_cq       — XDP TX completion
```

The split-RG ceiling still looks dominated by virtualization and queueing, not
raw CPU exhaustion (~95% idle at 3.5 Gbps). That said, the userspace path still
has real NAT and cache-hit overhead worth removing before treating the VM ceiling
as final.

### Direct Path -P8 (23 Gbps, for comparison)

```
15.9%  poll_binding              — packet processing
10.3%  enqueue_pending_forwards  — frame build + segmentation
 2.0%  parse_session_flow        — packet parsing
 1.5%  drain_pending_tx          — TX completions
 1.3%  cached_flow_decision_valid — HA check (per-packet) [now replaced by inline lease check, PR #432]
 1.2%  target_index              — binding lookup
```
