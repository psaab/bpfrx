# #965: bucketed timer-wheel session GC (replace O(N) scan)

Plan v6 — 2026-04-29. Addresses Codex round-5
(task-mok0rvip-n6iba1): per-tick complexity model conflated
"sessions / 256" with "live wheel entries / 256". Under sustained
per-second touch the wheel can hold up to N × 256 entries (mostly
stale duplicates), giving ~N entries per popped bucket — not N/256.
Plan now distinguishes realistic-mixed vs. sustained-per-second-touch
cost regimes, fixes the contradictory "low single-digit GB" claim
against the 12.3 GB ceiling at 1M × per-second-touch, removes the
residual ~30× slab claim, and adds an explicit acceptance gate for
the sustained-per-second-touch worst-plausible hot-path workload.

Earlier iterations (round 3 fixed the bucket-helper / pop race and
the alias `WheelEntry` payload; round 4 fixed memory math and the
alias borrow shape) remain in effect.

## Investigation findings (Claude, on commit 08ff1838)

`SessionTable.expire_stale_entries` at `userspace-dp/src/session.rs:279-340`
runs once per `SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_NS = 1s`. Inside that gate it does:

```rust
let stale = self.sessions.iter()
    .filter_map(|(key, entry)| {
        if now_ns.saturating_sub(entry.last_seen_ns) > entry.expires_after_ns {
            Some(key.clone())
        } else { None }
    })
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
// then iterate stale and remove each
```

This is O(N) over the entire `FxHashMap<SessionKey, SessionEntry>`
every tick. At 1M concurrent sessions (a realistic 100G workload):

- Hash-map iter + entry-tuple copy ≈ 100 ns/entry → ~100 ms per tick.
- Two `Vec` allocations per tick (`stale`, `expired_entries`).
- The hot worker thread BLOCKS for those 100 ms — every queue
  starves, mouse-latency p99 jumps to >100 ms, and the XSK RX rings
  back-pressure into the kernel.

This is the "stop the world" GC pause #965 calls out.

### Where last_seen / expires_after are written

- `install_with_protocol` (L484) — initial insert.
- `upsert_synced` (L554) — HA peer sync insert.
- `update_session` (L612) — protocol-specific update.
- `lookup_with_origin` (L390) — every read also touches last_seen
  (this is the most frequent path; ~per session-miss-cached-hit).
- `touch` (L274) — flow-cache amortized keepalive.
- `refresh_local` / `refresh_for_ha_activation` /
  `refresh_for_ha_transition` — HA state-machine paths.

Any change to expiration management has to thread these write sites.

## Approach

Add a **bucketed timer wheel** that mirrors the `sessions` HashMap.
On insert / touch / refresh, push the key into the bucket whose
index = `(last_seen_ns + expires_after_ns) / TICK_NS` modulo the
wheel size. On GC tick, pop one bucket and walk only those keys.

The wheel is purely an *index*; the authoritative state still lives
in `sessions: FxHashMap<SessionKey, SessionEntry>`. We do NOT
require #964's slab + integer handle refactor for #965 to land.

### Wheel shape

```rust
const WHEEL_TICK_NS: u64 = 1_000_000_000;        // 1 s
const WHEEL_BUCKETS: usize = 256;                // 256 s window
const WHEEL_MASK: u64 = (WHEEL_BUCKETS as u64) - 1; // 0xFF

/// What a wheel bucket holds. The `scheduled_tick` is the
/// expiration tick at the moment of bucketing — used by `pop`
/// to distinguish stale duplicates (`scheduled_tick !=
/// entry.wheel_tick`) from genuinely-due entries
/// (`scheduled_tick == entry.wheel_tick`).
pub(crate) struct WheelEntry {
    pub key: SessionKey,
    pub scheduled_tick: u64,
}

pub(crate) struct SessionWheel {
    /// 256 buckets indexed by `expiration_tick & WHEEL_MASK`.
    /// Each bucket holds entries whose `scheduled_tick` modulo
    /// 256 equals the bucket index.
    buckets: Box<[VecDeque<WheelEntry>; WHEEL_BUCKETS]>,
    /// Tick that bucket index 0 represents on the *current*
    /// wheel revolution. Advanced lazily as `cursor_tick`
    /// crosses bucket boundaries.
    base_tick: u64,
    /// Most-recent processed tick. Strictly < the live `now_tick`
    /// once initialized. Initialized lazily on the first
    /// insert/touch/expire that observes a `now_ns`.
    cursor_tick: u64,
    /// `false` until the first observation of `now_ns`. Until then
    /// every wheel mutation resets cursor/base from `now_ns`. This
    /// avoids the catastrophe of `cursor_tick = 0` being many
    /// years behind `now_tick = uptime_secs` on the first GC call.
    initialized: bool,
}
```

### Cursor / base initialization (Codex finding #1)

`SessionTable::new()` does not have a `now_ns`. The wheel must be
created in an "uninitialized" state and lazily initialize on the
first observation of `now_ns` from any of the touch/insert/expire
paths:

```rust
fn wheel_observe(&mut self, now_ns: u64) {
    if !self.wheel.initialized {
        let now_tick = now_ns / WHEEL_TICK_NS;
        self.wheel.base_tick = now_tick;
        self.wheel.cursor_tick = now_tick;
        self.wheel.initialized = true;
    }
}
```

Every public method that takes `now_ns` calls `wheel_observe(now_ns)`
before any wheel push or pop. Test:
`first_gc_with_large_monotonic_now_doesnt_walk_billions_of_buckets`.

### Bucket-index calculation (Codex round-3 finding #1 — absolute, not relative)

There is exactly ONE bucket helper. It takes an absolute target
tick (the tick the entry should be checked at) and returns
`(target_tick & WHEEL_MASK) as usize`. Both `push` and `pop` use
the same formula.

```rust
const FAR_FUTURE_OFFSET: u64 = WHEEL_BUCKETS as u64 - 1;

#[inline]
fn bucket_for_tick(tick: u64) -> usize {
    (tick & WHEEL_MASK) as usize
}

/// Compute the absolute target tick at which an entry with the
/// given expiration_ns should be checked, given the current
/// `now_ns`. Returns `now_tick + delta.min(FAR_FUTURE_OFFSET)`.
/// An entry with delta >= WHEEL_BUCKETS lands FAR_FUTURE_OFFSET
/// ticks ahead and gets re-checked there (still-alive case
/// triggers re-bucketing in pop).
fn target_tick_for(now_ns: u64, expiration_ns: u64) -> u64 {
    let now_tick = now_ns / WHEEL_TICK_NS;
    let expiration_tick = expiration_ns / WHEEL_TICK_NS;
    let delta = expiration_tick.saturating_sub(now_tick);
    now_tick + delta.min(FAR_FUTURE_OFFSET)
}
```

Use absolute target ticks throughout. The `target_tick` is what's
written into `entry.wheel_tick` and `WheelEntry.scheduled_tick`.
At pop time, `self.wheel.cursor_tick` advances absolutely; the
bucket index is just `(cursor_tick & WHEEL_MASK)`. The
"exactly 256s" case lands at `now_tick + 255`, which the wheel
will revisit only after a full rotation — distinct from the
current bucket. Test: `wheel_handles_exact_256s_timeout`.

### Coverage of long-lived sessions

The default established-TCP timeout in `userspace-dp/src/session.rs`
is 300 s (`DEFAULT_TCP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_NS = 300_000_000_000`), which
is already larger than the 256-s wheel window. Operators can set
arbitrarily long per-protocol timeouts (Junos allows up to days).
Any timeout that exceeds the 256-s window lands in the far-future
bucket. When that bucket is popped (256 s after insertion),
`wheel_pop_one_bucket` re-checks the entry's actual
`last_seen + expires_after` against `now_ns`, finds it still in the
future, and re-buckets via the same logic. Cost: one HashMap
lookup + one push per long session per 256 s.

### Push-to-wheel: when, and the duplicate bound (Codex round-2 #2)

When `install` / `upsert_synced` / `lookup_with_origin` / `update_session`
/ `refresh_*` updates `last_seen_ns` or `expires_after_ns`, we may
need to add a wheel entry. To bound duplicates we throttle:

```rust
let new_expiration_tick = target_tick_for(
    now_ns,
    entry.last_seen_ns + entry.expires_after_ns,
);
if new_expiration_tick != entry.wheel_tick {
    entry.wheel_tick = new_expiration_tick;
    let bucket = bucket_for_tick(new_expiration_tick);
    self.wheel.buckets[bucket].push_back(WheelEntry {
        key: actual_key.clone(),
        scheduled_tick: new_expiration_tick,
    });
}
// Same-tick touches: no push.
```

The wheel push happens only when the expiration TICK changes. A
session touched 1000 times within the same second produces ZERO
extra wheel entries.

Note: this snippet is the throttle *condition* in isolation. In a
real call site (e.g. `update_session`, `lookup_with_origin`), the
`&mut SessionEntry` borrow on `self.sessions` MUST be scoped to
end before the `self.wheel.buckets[...]` push, or the borrow
checker will reject the compound `&mut self` aliasing. See the
alias correctness section below for the full borrow-scoped shape.

#### Memory math (corrected per Codex rounds 2 + 4)

Measured (`rustc 1.x`, 64-bit):
- `size_of::<SessionKey>()` = **40 B** (u8 + u8 + 2×IpAddr(17 B) + u16 + u16, align 2)
- `size_of::<WheelEntry>()` = **48 B** (40 B SessionKey + u64 + alignment padding to 8 B, align 8)

Live wheel storage is bounded by the wheel itself: the wheel only
holds entries whose `scheduled_tick ∈ [cursor_tick, cursor_tick +
FAR_FUTURE_OFFSET]`, i.e. at most 256 distinct future-tick slots.
For each session, throttling caps push frequency at one push per
TICK in which `(last_seen + expires_after)` produces a new
`scheduled_tick`. Stale entries (where the canonical `wheel_tick`
has moved on) are not deleted eagerly — they sit in the wheel until
their bucket is popped, at which point the lazy-delete discriminator
drops them in O(1).

Therefore:

  live_wheel_entries ≤ Σ over live sessions of
                       min(distinct_active_touch_ticks_in_last_256s, 256)
                       + recently-superseded duplicates not yet drained

The drain time of a stale duplicate is bounded by one wheel
rotation: ≤ 256 s after it was superseded. So the steady-state
upper bound is ≈ N_sessions × 256 entries (the absolute ceiling),
and the realistic value is much smaller because most sessions are
idle and touch in <<256 distinct ticks.

| Workload | Active touch ticks / sess | Live entries at 100K sessions | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idle TCP keepalive (rare touch) | ~1 | ~100K | ~4.8 MB |
| Mostly-idle session table | ~3–5 | ~300K–500K | ~14–24 MB |
| Active TCP throughput (touch ≤1/s) | up to 256 | ≤25.6M | ≤1.2 GB |
| Pathological (every session, every tick) | 256 | 25.6M | 1.2 GB |

At 1M sessions × 256 × 48 B the absolute ceiling is **~12.3 GB**.
That ceiling is reached only when every session is touched in 256
distinct seconds inside a 256-s window, which already implies a 1M-
session steady state with continuous activity. The realistic value
is well under 100 MB.

This is honest: the wheel storage cost is bounded by `N × WHEEL_BUCKETS`,
not by session lifetime. The earlier draft's "linear with
lifetime_secs" claim was wrong — once GC keeps up with the wheel
rotation, stale duplicates are drained within 256 s and don't
accumulate over the full session lifetime.

#964 (slot-handle compaction) replaces the 40-B `SessionKey` with a
~4-B slot index, taking `WheelEntry` from 48 B to ~16 B — roughly
**3× smaller** (not 30×; the 30× figure assumed the 248-B miscount).
That follow-up is meaningful at scale: at 1M sessions × per-second
touch, 12.3 GB drops to ~4 GB. Active deletion (per Out of scope)
takes that further by bounding live entries to N (one per
session) — at 1M × 16 B = ~16 MB. Either follow-up is the right
venue for solving the ceiling at the per-second-touch worst case;
#965 alone delivers the realistic-deployment win and the
per-tick-bound shape, with a documented memory ceiling that grows
proportionally to N × WHEEL_BUCKETS under adversarial touch
patterns.

**Decision**: ship #965 with the corrected algorithm + this
honest memory math. Document the "every-session-touched-every-tick
at 1M scale" worst case as the boundary. The bigger #964 slab
refactor is the right venue for solving the duplicate-storage
size; #965 alone delivers the "no Stop-the-World" win for the
realistic case.

### Per-tick GC work — the algorithm in full

Per Codex findings #2/#3/#5/#8: cap-vs-uncapped, deferred-tail
semantics, alias-key correctness, and the off-by-1-ns expiry
boundary all need explicit pseudocode.

Decision per Codex finding #2: **no per-tick cap**. The cap was a
flawed knob — at 5K/tick when due-rate is ≥5K/s the backlog grows
unbounded. We pay the bucket cost. Multi-level wheels and active
deletion are deferred to follow-ups (see Out of scope).

#### Per-tick cost model (corrected per Codex round-5 #1)

Per-tick work = `O(K)` where `K` is the number of `WheelEntry`s
sitting in the popped bucket at that moment. Each entry costs:

  - 1 FxHashMap lookup on `self.sessions[key]` (~80–150 ns)
  - 1 tick-comparison branch (entry-gone / stale / expired / re-bucket)
  - In the stale and gone cases: O(1) drop and continue
  - In the expired case: 1 HashMap remove + delta push
  - In the re-bucket case: 1 HashMap mut + 1 wheel push

Per-entry cost is dominated by the HashMap lookup. Realistic
estimate: ~100 ns per stale/gone entry, ~300 ns per expired/re-
bucketed entry.

`K` is bounded by the number of pushes that landed in this bucket
since it was last popped (one wheel rotation = 256 s ago) minus
those popped at the start of this rotation. Push frequency per
session is throttled to "1 per second-aligned `scheduled_tick`
that the canonical `wheel_tick` advances onto". So under the
**worst plausible hot-path workload — every session touched at
least once per second**, each session contributes one push per
second, and over a full 256-s rotation produces 256 entries (255
of which are stale duplicates by the time their bucket is popped).

Concretely:

  total_wheel_entries ≤ Σ over sessions of
                        (distinct `scheduled_tick`s pushed in last 256 s)
                      ≤ N_sessions × min(touches_per_256s, 256)

For a population with **uniform per-second touch on every session**:

  total_wheel_entries ≈ N_sessions × 256
  K (per bucket)      ≈ N_sessions
  per-tick cost       ≈ N_sessions × 100 ns

| N (sessions) | per-second touch | mostly idle (avg ≤5 active ticks/sess) |
|---|---|---|
| 10K | 1 ms | 200 µs |
| 100K | **10 ms** | 2 ms |
| 1M | **100 ms** | 20 ms |

#### What this means for "Stop the World goes away"

Today's StW does ~100 ms once per `SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_NS = 1 s`
at 1M sessions. The wheel does **the same total work over the
1 s window**, but spread across 256 ticks at the same per-second
*shape* — so each tick still has to drain its bucket at full
size. **The wheel does not dramatically reduce the worst-case
tick wall-time under sustained per-second touch on every
session**: at 1M sessions × per-second touch, both today's StW
and the wheel produce ~100 ms of GC work per second, just paid in
different shapes (one 100-ms blast vs. ~256 × ~0.4-ms drains —
but each of those 256 drains visits a *different* bucket, and
only ONE of them holds the per-second-touch crowd).

The win, restated honestly:

1. **Realistic mixed-traffic deployments** (most sessions idle,
   some bursty): per-tick cost drops from O(N) to
   O(N × distinct_active_ticks / 256), which at 100K sessions is
   sub-ms — a **>50× improvement** in the typical case.

2. **All-active per-second-touch on every session at 100K**:
   per-tick cost is ~10 ms, vs. today's ~10 ms StW (same scale).
   The win here is *not* a wall-time reduction; it's that the
   work is bounded per-tick rather than appearing as a single
   blocking call. Mouse-latency p99 stops correlating with the
   GC interval.

3. **All-active per-second-touch on every session at 1M**:
   per-tick cost is ~100 ms. **This is the same wall time as
   today's StW.** The wheel does not solve this case; it tracks
   under "active deletion" and "multi-level wheel" follow-ups.
   At this scale we recommend operators tune
   `SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_NS` higher or land #964 first.

4. **Same-bucket install bursts** (synthetic: all N sessions
   installed in one tick, then idle): bucket sees O(N) work *once*
   per 256 s, then idles. No worse than today's StW for that one
   tick; better for the other 255 ticks.

#### Acceptance gate (corrected per Codex round-5 #2)

The mouse-latency gate (Acceptance gates §4) needs two distinct
synthetic workloads:

A. **Realistic mostly-idle**: 50K sessions, ~10% touched per
   second (5K touches/s), the rest idle. Assert p99 GC-tick wall
   time ≤ 1 ms. This is the realistic-deployment claim.

B. **Sustained per-second touch (worst-plausible hot path)**:
   100K sessions, EVERY session touched once per second for ≥
   300 s before assertion. Assert p99 GC-tick wall time ≤ 15 ms
   (matches the ~10 ms model + headroom). This proves the wheel
   bounds per-tick work and prevents StW spikes even under the
   worst sustained refresh pattern; it does NOT claim a
   wall-time win at this load.

Adversarial same-bucket install bursts are out of scope for #965
and tracked under the active-deletion / multi-level-wheel follow-
ups.

```rust
pub fn expire_stale_entries(&mut self, now_ns: u64) -> Vec<ExpiredSession> {
    if self.last_gc_ns != 0 && now_ns.saturating_sub(self.last_gc_ns) < SESSION_GC_INTERVAL_NS {
        return Vec::new();
    }
    self.last_gc_ns = now_ns;
    self.wheel_observe(now_ns);  // lazy init if first call

    let now_tick = now_ns / WHEEL_TICK_NS;
    let mut expired = Vec::new();
    // Cursor starts at the lazy-init now_tick, so the first call
    // after init is a no-op (loop body runs zero times).
    while self.wheel.cursor_tick < now_tick {
        let bucket_idx = bucket_for_tick(self.wheel.cursor_tick);
        // Drain in place into a local Vec, then process. We cannot
        // hold a `&mut VecDeque` from the wheel and simultaneously
        // call `self.wheel.buckets[new_bucket].push_back(...)` for
        // a re-bucket whose target may equal `bucket_idx` — that
        // would alias the same VecDeque mutably. Round-3 caught
        // the v3 same-bucket-reinsert race that arose from
        // `mem::take` followed by `buckets[idx] = due` overwriting
        // re-bucketed entries. Drain → local Vec → free up the
        // wheel reference → process from the local Vec.
        let due_count = self.wheel.buckets[bucket_idx].len();
        let mut due_buf: Vec<WheelEntry> = Vec::with_capacity(due_count);
        while let Some(entry) = self.wheel.buckets[bucket_idx].pop_front() {
            due_buf.push(entry);
        }
        for WheelEntry { key, scheduled_tick } in due_buf.drain(..) {
            let Some(entry) = self.sessions.get(&key) else {
                // Already removed elsewhere — drop hint.
                continue;
            };

                // to a different tick. The new tick has its own
                // wheel entry already.

            }
            // scheduled_tick matches entry.wheel_tick — this is the

                if let Some(removed) = self.remove_entry(&key) {
                    // ... emit SessionDelta + ExpiredSession ...
                    expired.push(...);
                }
            } else {
                // Still alive — long-timeout (>= 256s) case, or a
                // session re-scheduled to exactly this tick. Re-
                // bucket at the new absolute target tick. The new
                // bucket may be `bucket_idx` again (e.g. exactly
                // 256s timeout repeats); that's fine because the
                // wheel's bucket VecDeque is now empty (we drained
                // into due_buf above), so the push goes to the
                // correct slot and is NOT overwritten on loop exit.
                let new_target_tick = target_tick_for(
                    now_ns,
                    entry.last_seen_ns + entry.expires_after_ns,
                );
                let new_bucket = bucket_for_tick(new_target_tick);
                let entry_mut = self.sessions.get_mut(&key)
                    .expect("entry was just read");
                entry_mut.wheel_tick = new_target_tick;
                self.wheel.buckets[new_bucket].push_back(WheelEntry {
                    key,
                    scheduled_tick: new_target_tick,
                });
            }
        }
        self.wheel.cursor_tick = self.wheel.cursor_tick.saturating_add(1);
    }
    self.wheel.base_tick = now_tick;
    expired
}
```

This algorithm correctly handles four cases on pop:
1. **Entry gone** (already removed by another path) — drop hint.
2. **Stale duplicate** (`wheel_tick != scheduled_tick`) — drop, the
   new scheduled tick has its own entry.
3. **Actually expired** — remove, emit ExpiredSession + delta.
4. **Still alive at the canonical scheduled tick** — long-timeout
   case (e.g. 300s TCP-ESTABLISHED). Re-bucket at the new
   expiration tick. This is the case that v2's pseudocode dropped
   incorrectly (Codex round-2 finding #1).

### Alias correctness in lookup_with_origin (Codex finding #5)

`lookup_with_origin` resolves NAT aliases via
`reverse_translated_index`. The wheel push must use `actual_key`
(the canonical key the entry is stored under), NOT the caller's
alias key. Otherwise the wheel push goes to the wrong shard and
the canonical entry never gets its expiration refreshed.

```rust
let actual_key = if self.sessions.contains_key(key) {
    key.clone()
} else if let Some(alias) = self.reverse_translated_index.get(key) {
    alias.clone()
} else {
    return None;
};

// Scope the &mut self.sessions borrow so it ends BEFORE we touch
// self.wheel. Without this scoping the closure form
// `self.sessions.get_mut(...).map(|entry| { ... self.wheel ... })`
// holds a mutable borrow on `self` (via `self.sessions`) and a
// second mutable borrow on `self.wheel` simultaneously, which the
// borrow checker rejects.
let push_tick: Option<u64> = {
    let entry = self.sessions.get_mut(&actual_key)?;
    // ... last_seen_ns / expires_after_ns updates ...
    let new_expiration_tick = target_tick_for(
        now_ns,
        entry.last_seen_ns + entry.expires_after_ns,
    );
    if new_expiration_tick != entry.wheel_tick {
        entry.wheel_tick = new_expiration_tick;
        Some(new_expiration_tick)
    } else {
        None
    }
}; // <-- &mut self.sessions borrow ends here

if let Some(tick) = push_tick {
    // PUSH actual_key, not the alias `key`. Payload must be a
    // WheelEntry carrying the canonical scheduled_tick so pop's
    // lazy-delete discriminator can detect staleness.
    let bucket = bucket_for_tick(tick);
    self.wheel.buckets[bucket].push_back(WheelEntry {
        key: actual_key.clone(),
        scheduled_tick: tick,
    });
}

// Build the SessionLookup return value via a fresh & immutable
// borrow on self.sessions (the &mut borrow above has dropped).
self.sessions.get(&actual_key).map(|entry| {
    // ... return SessionLookup ...
})
```

Test: `wheel_alias_lookup_refreshes_canonical_key`.

### Hot-path allocation: lazy-grow with documented warm-up (Codex round-2 #3)

Round-1's `max_sessions / WHEEL_BUCKETS` reserve was wrong: short-
timeout workloads concentrate sessions in a small number of "live"
buckets (those between `cursor_tick` and `cursor_tick +
typical_timeout_ticks`). For a 30s timeout × 100K sessions, only
30 of 256 buckets see traffic at steady state, and each holds
~3300 entries — far above the proposed 100K/256 = 390 reserve.
Pre-reserving 390 per bucket means every active bucket reallocates
2-3× as it grows.

**Decision**: don't pre-reserve at all. Construct each VecDeque
empty (24 B header). On the hot path, the FIRST `push_back` to
each bucket allocates a small backing buffer; subsequent pushes
amortize Vec-style geometric growth. Steady-state allocation
amortizes across the bucket lifetime (up to 256 ticks).

Drop the "no allocations on the hot path" claim entirely. The
honest phrasing is: "amortized O(1) push, occasional reallocation
during bucket warmup". `VecDeque` doubles its backing buffer
geometrically, so for a steady-state size of ~B entries it
reallocates `~log2(B)` times during warm-up; each realloc copies
*all* current elements (so the realloc just before reaching
capacity B copies up to B−1 elements). For B=3K and B_avg ≈ B/2
across the warm-up, the per-bucket warm-up moves ≈ B − 1 ≈ 3K
elements total. Across 256 buckets that's 256 × 3K = ~768K
element-moves during warm-up at 48 B each ≈ ~36 MB total. Spread
over 256 ticks (256 s wall time), that's ~150 KB/s of allocator
traffic. Negligible vs the per-packet hot path.

After warm-up (after first wheel rotation), each bucket's VecDeque
has settled at ~max-bucket-size capacity. New pushes don't grow.

```rust
fn new_wheel() -> SessionWheel {
    let mut buckets: Vec<VecDeque<WheelEntry>> = Vec::with_capacity(WHEEL_BUCKETS);
    for _ in 0..WHEEL_BUCKETS {
        // Lazy: first push allocates the backing buffer.
        buckets.push(VecDeque::new());
    }
    let buckets: Box<[VecDeque<WheelEntry>; WHEEL_BUCKETS]> =
        buckets.into_boxed_slice().try_into().expect("right size");
    SessionWheel { buckets, base_tick: 0, cursor_tick: 0, initialized: false }
}
```

Construction memory cost: 256 × 24 B = 6 KB. Steady state: bucket
buffers grow to fit avg load × geometric headroom. For typical
100K × 30s workloads, ~30 active buckets × ~3K entries × 48 B =
~4.3 MB.

### Files touched

- `userspace-dp/src/session.rs`: add `SessionWheel` (~150 LOC),
  add wheel push at insert/touch/refresh sites, replace
  `expire_stale_entries` body with wheel pop. ~250 LOC change.
  Public API unchanged.

### Tests

- `wheel_pops_expired_entry_from_bucket`: insert one session, advance
  time past its timeout, verify expire_stale_entries returns it.
- `wheel_skips_touched_entry`: insert, touch (advances last_seen),
  advance time past original bucket but before new bucket; verify
  expire_stale_entries does NOT return it.
- `wheel_handles_long_timeout_via_far_future_bucket`: insert with
  timeout > 256s; verify entry doesn't expire prematurely; advance
  past 256s; verify entry re-buckets and expires correctly later.
- `wheel_handles_exact_256s_timeout` (Codex finding #4): insert
  with `expires_after_ns == WHEEL_BUCKETS * WHEEL_TICK_NS`. Verify
  the entry lands in the FAR_FUTURE bucket (not the current one)
  and gets re-checked after the wheel rotation.
- `wheel_alias_lookup_refreshes_canonical_key` (Codex finding #5):
  install entry under canonical key K; lookup via NAT alias key A
  (where reverse_translated_index[A] = K); verify the wheel push
  goes to K's bucket, not A's.
- `first_gc_with_large_monotonic_now_doesnt_walk_billions_of_buckets`
  (Codex finding #1): construct fresh SessionTable; call
  expire_stale_entries with `now_ns = 10^18` (wall-time-ish big);
  verify it returns immediately (no infinite loop, no panic).
- `expiry_boundary_strict_greater_than` (Codex finding #8): insert
  entry with `expires_after_ns = 1_000_000_000`; advance to
  exactly `last_seen + 1_000_000_000` (boundary); verify entry is
  NOT expired (matches today's `>` semantics, not `>=`).
- `wheel_duplicate_count_per_session_bounded` (Codex finding #7):
  insert one session; touch it 100 times within the same tick;
  count wheel entries for that key; assert ≤ 2 (the initial push
  + at most one re-push if expiration tick changed).
- `wheel_sustained_overload_drains_all_buckets`: insert 50K
  sessions all with same expiration; advance time past expiration;
  verify expire_stale_entries returns all 50K in a single call
  (no per-tick cap; one tick = one bucket = O(B) work, not capped).
- `wheel_per_second_touch_bound_per_tick_work` (Codex round-5 #2):
  install N=10K sessions, then touch every session once per
  second for 300 s of simulated time before measuring. After
  warm-up, advance one tick and measure `wheel_pop_one_bucket`
  wall time. Assert ≤ 5 ms (allows 2.5× headroom over the 100 ns
  × 10K = 1 ms model). This catches regressions where a refactor
  inadvertently makes `lookup_with_origin` or `update_session`
  add multiple wheel pushes per touch.
- `wheel_alias_lookup_does_not_double_borrow_self`: compile-time
  test that the alias path's `lookup_with_origin` body type-checks
  (i.e. the &mut self.sessions borrow is scoped before
  self.wheel.buckets is touched). This is enforced by the borrow
  checker; the test exists to guard against future refactors that
  reintroduce a `.map(|entry| { ... self.wheel ... })` shape.
- `wheel_handles_concurrent_insert_and_pop`: not relevant
  (SessionTable is not Send + Sync — owned by a single worker;
  Codex confirmed worker.rs:490 has `let mut sessions = ...`).

Plus 4 existing GC tests (lines 2138, 2142, 2162, +1 more) must
continue to pass.

## Acceptance gates

1. `cargo build --release` clean.
2. `cargo test --release` ≥ baseline (851 post-#921) + 10 new = 861.
3. Cluster smoke (HARD): no regression on the unloaded-session path.
   - iperf-c P=12 ≥ 22 Gb/s
   - iperf-c P=1 ≥ 6 Gb/s
4. **Mouse-latency gate** — TWO synthetic workloads (per Codex
   round-5 #2):

   4a. **Realistic mostly-idle**: 50K sessions, ~10% touched per
       second (5K touches/s), the rest idle for ≥ 300 s before
       measurement. Assert p99 GC-tick wall time ≤ 1 ms. This is
       the typical-deployment win.

   4b. **Sustained per-second touch**: 10K sessions, EVERY session
       touched once per second for ≥ 300 s. Assert p99 GC-tick
       wall time ≤ 5 ms (matches the 100 ns × 10K = 1 ms model
       with 5× headroom). This proves the wheel keeps per-tick
       work bounded under the hot-path refresh shape; it does NOT
       claim a wall-time win at this load — see "Per-tick cost
       model" in §Per-tick GC work.

   Both gates must hold. Adversarial same-bucket install bursts
   are out of scope for #965 and tracked under the active-
   deletion / multi-level-wheel follow-ups (see Out of scope).
5. Codex hostile review: AGREE-TO-MERGE.
6. Gemini adversarial review: AGREE-TO-MERGE.

## Risk

**Medium.**

- Wheel is purely an index; `sessions` HashMap is authoritative
  state.
- Stale-duplicate vs. canonical pop is decided by
  `entry.wheel_tick == scheduled_tick`. Long-timeout entries get
  re-bucketed correctly per the algorithm in §"Per-tick GC work".
- Memory growth scales with sessions × distinct expiration ticks
  visited per session. For typical workloads that's ≤MB; for
  pathological dense-throughput workloads it grows toward GB
  scale. #964's slab is the right place to fix this; #965 ships
  with this caveat documented.
- `wheel_tick: u64` adds 8 B to `SessionEntry`. At 100K sessions
  ≈ 800 KB. Acceptable.

Risk areas:
- `touch` / `lookup_with_origin` add a wheel push when the
  expiration tick changes. Same-tick touches are no-ops. The push
  is amortized O(1) `VecDeque::push_back` with occasional
  reallocation during bucket warm-up.

## Out of scope

- #964 (slab + integer handles): `sessions` stays as
  `FxHashMap<SessionKey, SessionEntry>`. The wheel uses
  `WheelEntry { SessionKey, scheduled_tick }` as the bucket
  payload. After #964, the payload becomes
  `WheelEntry { SlotHandle, scheduled_tick }` — same structure,
  ~3× smaller (16 B vs 48 B). The path between #965 and #964 is
  mechanical.
- Active wheel-entry deletion (intrusive doubly-linked list per
  bucket with back-reference in SessionEntry). Would bound live
  wheel entries at exactly N (one per session) instead of up to
  N × 256 under sustained per-tick touch. Significantly more code;
  defer to a follow-up if the per-tick cost under adversarial
  workloads becomes a problem.
- Multi-level wheels (hashed timing wheels): the single wheel +
  re-bucket-on-still-alive is enough for the typical 100K-session
  / ≤300 s timeout case. Multi-level is a follow-up if profiling
  shows the per-bucket spike under sustained per-tick touch
  (analyzed below) is an issue.
- Per-protocol expire policy refactor: timeouts are still computed
  from `key.protocol` and `tcp_flags` at insert/update time.
