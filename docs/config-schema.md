# Config schema: the two-SSOT split (#1319)

xpf has **two** command-tree sources of truth. Knowing which one to edit
is the single most common mistake when adding CLI completion or config
validation.

## Operational tree → `pkg/cmdtree`

`run` / `show` / `clear` / `request` / `monitor` / `ping` / `traceroute`
and friends are defined in `pkg/cmdtree/tree.go` (`OperationalTree`).
Adding an operational command there propagates to all three frontends
(local CLI, remote CLI, gRPC) for tab completion and `?` help. Operational
leaves may be typed (`Node.ValueType` / `ValueDesc` / `ValueExamples` /
`Validator`).

## Config-mode grammar → `pkg/config` `setSchema`

The `set` / `delete` / `show` / `edit` configuration grammar is owned by
`config.setSchema` (a tree of `schemaNode` rooted in `pkg/config/schema.go`),
NOT by cmdtree. Since the #1891 domain split, `schema.go` holds the
`schemaNode` type and the root composition; the per-domain subtrees live in
sibling aspect files in the same package (`schema_security.go`,
`schema_interfaces.go`, `schema_routing.go`, `schema_system.go`,
`schema_chassis.go`, `schema_cos.go` — see the file map in `schema.go`).
`setSchema` drives **four** things off one tree:

1. **Structural completion** — what keywords are valid at each position.
2. **Flat-set token grouping** — how `set a b c d` packs into AST
   `Node.Keys` (`SetPath`, `ast_edit.go`). This is parser-critical: the
   replace-vs-container decision keys on `children == nil`.
3. **Value-slot `?` completion** — for a typed leaf, the placeholder
   (`<rate>`) + example values (`CompleteSetPathWithValues`,
   `schema_complete.go`).
4. **Commit-check validation** — the typed-leaf gate
   (`SchemaValidate` + the generic walker in `schema_walk.go`). Strict
   ONLY on the operator-driven commit / commit-check path
   (`configstore.compileTree`); the tolerant `Store.Load` /
   `Store.SyncApply` ingress (`compileTreeLenient`) downgrades a
   violation to a `slog.Warn` so an already-persisted or peer-synced
   config carrying a value that was typed (or range-tightened) later
   cannot blackout-boot a node or alarm-loop HA config sync. Boot
   safety is non-negotiable: when you tighten a range, any legacy value
   the compiler accepted MUST still load (`TestLoad_ToleratesStored*`
   in `pkg/configstore`).

Because completion (3) and validation (4) read the SAME node, they cannot
drift — typing a leaf fixes both `set ... ?` help and `commit check`
rejection together.

The live config-mode completers — `pkg/cli` `completeConfigWithDesc` and
`pkg/grpcapi` `completeConfigPairs` — route `set` paths through
`config.CompleteSetPathWithValues` over `setSchema`. `cmdtree.ConfigTopLevel`
only supplies the config-mode TOP-LEVEL keywords (`set`/`delete`/`commit`/
`load`/...) plus the retained `set system dataplane` description overlay.

## How to add a config-mode typed leaf

Edit the leaf's `schemaNode` in `setSchema` (in the domain's
`pkg/config/schema_<domain>.go` aspect file). Set:

```go
"transmit-rate": {
    args:          1,
    valueType:     ValueRate,                // placeholder + opt-in
    valueDesc:     "Bandwidth (e.g. 100k, 10m, 1g) ...",
    valueExamples: []string{"100k", "10m", "1g"},
    validator:     ValidateRate,             // commit-check
    children:      map[string]*schemaNode{   // modifiers ONLY if pre-existing
        "exact": {children: nil},
    },
},
```

Rules:

- **Range policy: runtime first, Junos second.** The binding bound is
  what the xpf runtime actually consumes — the narrowest binary encoding
  (e.g. `cluster-id` is one byte of the RETH virtual MAC;
  `reth-advertise-interval` must encode into the 12-bit VRRPv3
  centisecond field) or an explicit runtime clamp/ignore. Check the
  Junos vSRX range second and call out deliberate divergences in the
  annotation comment: xpf's own defaults sit OUTSIDE the Junos ranges
  for several chassis knobs (heartbeat-interval default 100 ms vs Junos
  1000..2000), and the killed #1319 Phase-3a plan copied Junos ranges
  blindly — it would have rejected deployed configs. **No schema-only
  caps** (Codex review, PR #1845): if the runtime accepts any value, use
  min-only semantics (`ValidateIntegerMin`) or the runtime-derived
  ceiling (`MaxDurationMillis` for millisecond knobs that convert to
  `time.Duration`); a sanity cap must be enforced in the runtime FIRST,
  never in the schema alone. Cite the source file:line for every bound
  next to the annotation.
- **Fields only, do not add a `children` map just to type a leaf.** SetPath's
  grouping keys on `children == nil` (`ast_edit.go:196`); flipping a leaf to
  a container changes flat-set grouping for existing configs. The
  `TestSetPathGrouping_Golden` test in
  `pkg/config/schema_validate_test.go` guards this.
- **Only type a leaf the compiler actually consumes.** Typing a leaf the
  compiler ignores would make `commit check` reject config the compiler
  would have silently dropped — a behaviour change beyond completion/
  validation. (This is why scheduler `buffer-size temporal` was NOT carried
  over: the compiler never reads it.)
- **Validators live in `pkg/config/schema_validators.go`** and are stateless
  string-checkers reusing the compiler's parsers. Add a generic one
  (`ValidateInteger(min,max)`, `ValidateEnum([...])`, the IP family
  validators `ValidateIPAddress` / `ValidateIPv4CIDR` / `ValidateIPv6CIDR`)
  or a bespoke `ValidateX(raw string, cfg *Config) error`. **cfg is always
  nil in production** — both call sites run the gate BEFORE compile
  (`configstore.compileTree` / `compileTreeLenient`), so a validator must
  never depend on compiled state. Cross-reference validators use the
  TREE-based `treeValidator` field instead: `SchemaValidate` pre-collects
  referenceable definitions from the candidate tree into `schemaRefs`
  (`collectSchemaRefs`, e.g. the forwarding-class names) and hands them to
  the validator, so a definition + reference in the same commit validate
  atomically. The refs union includes group bodies (applied or not) so
  node-variable configs never false-reject.
- **Typed KEY slots (named-instance containers).** A container whose value
  is its IDENTITY token (`family inet address <cidr> { primary; }`) cannot
  use `valueType`/`validator` — that would flip the walker into the
  typed-LEAF branch and mis-validate the container's real block children.
  Set `keyValueType`/`keyValueDesc`/`keyValueExamples`/`keyValidator`
  instead: the walker validates the identity arg token(s) in both the
  packed-Keys and the nested instance-name shapes (both of which
  `namedInstances` compiles), and `?` completion surfaces the key
  placeholder + examples at the empty identity slot.
- **Multi value-tail leaves accept the block-list spelling.** A
  `multi && children == nil` typed leaf is compiled from BOTH the packed
  Keys (`name-server 1.1.1.1`, ranges with the `to` separator) and the
  hierarchical block list (`name-server { 1.1.1.1; 8.8.8.8; }`) — the
  walker's `validateMultiValueLeaf` validates each block child's FIRST
  token, exactly what the compilers read.
- The generic walker (`schema_walk.go`) needs **no** changes per leaf — it
  descends `setSchema` and validates any typed leaf it finds. Walker rows it
  handles: container/args/compoundKey/midKeyword/wildcard, the standard
  typed leaf (first token is the value, remaining tokens must be known
  modifier children), the `multi && children == nil` value-tail/range shape
  (`destination-port 20000 to 20003`, rejecting dangling/all-separator
  tails), and the cross-sibling modifier-only line (`transmit-rate exact`
  valid only when a sibling leaf supplies the rate).
- **Compiler-faithful rule (important).** The walker validates typed leaves
  exactly where the per-subsystem compiler reads them. For a named-instance
  container (e.g. `class-of-service schedulers <name> { ... }`) the compiler
  reads leaves from the instance node's CHILDREN; tokens packed into the
  instance node's own Keys beyond the name are NOT compiled, so the walker
  ignores them — it never validates, nor mis-attributes block children to,
  such packed tokens. This means malformed shorthand the compiler silently
  discards (e.g. `schedulers be transmit-rate asd` as a single node with no
  children) is intentionally NOT rejected: rejecting config the compiler
  ignores is a behaviour change beyond #1319's compiled-leaf-only scope. The
  real symptom-2 path — `set class-of-service schedulers be transmit-rate
  asd` — lands the leaf as a CHILD, where it IS compiled and IS rejected.
  This contract was converged across 7 hostile Codex review rounds; do not
  re-add packed-tail validation without re-checking compiler reachability.

## Help-text discipline (#1892)

Every `schemaNode` in `setSchema` MUST carry a `desc:` — an empty desc
renders as a blank line in `?` completion across all three frontends.
The #1892 audit filled all 493 previously-empty nodes; do not add new
nodes without one. Rules:

- **Verified behavior only.** A wrong help text is worse than a missing
  one. Write the desc from the compiler/runtime consumer, not from what
  the keyword sounds like. Containers get structural descs ("Source NAT
  configuration"); behavior-bearing leaves state what the consumer does,
  with enum values / units / defaults in parens ONLY when read from
  code (model: `claim-host-tunables` — "Allow xpfd to write host-scope
  tunables (true|false, default false)").
- **desc / placeholder are display-only.** They never affect SetPath
  grouping, so help fixes are always grouping-safe. Structure fields
  (`args`, `children`, `wildcard`, `multi`) are NOT — see the typed-leaf
  rules above.
- **`groups <*>` mirrors the top level by pointer** (`init()` in
  `schema.go`), so a top-level desc automatically documents the same
  path under `groups <name> ...`. Never duplicate nodes to add help.

## Retired knobs (#1525 / #1892)

Retired DPDK-era `system dataplane` knobs — `cores`, `memory`,
`socket-mem`, `rx-mode {idle-threshold, resume-threshold,
sleep-timeout}`, `ports <name> {interface, rx-mode, cores}` — remain
parseable for stored-config compatibility (a stanza that committed once
must never stop loading), but have NO consumer:
`compileUserspaceDataplane` records them in
`UserspaceConfig.RetiredKnobsSeen` and `userspaceRetiredKnobWarnings`
emits a per-knob commit warning ("retired DPDK-era knob (#1525),
accepted for config compatibility but ignored") on both the strict and
lenient compile paths. Their schema descs say "(retired, ignored)" so
completion stops advertising them as live. Follow this pattern —
keep-parsing + warn + honest desc — when retiring any future knob;
hard-reject (the `dataplane-type dpdk` / `ebpf` sentinel errors) is
reserved for whole-dataplane selection where a rewrite shim
(`rewriteRetiredDataplaneType`) protects stored configs.

## Rollout (#1319)

- **PR 1 (merged, #1682):** moved `ValueType` to `pkg/config`; added the
  typed fields to `schemaNode`; wired typed-value `?` completion into
  `CompleteSetPathWithValues`; replaced the schedulers-only hand-rolled
  walker + class-of-service early-return with the generic
  `config.SchemaValidate` walker; re-homed the schedulers typed leaves onto
  `setSchema`; retired the cmdtree config-mode overlay. 3 typed leaves
  (schedulers transmit-rate / priority / buffer-size).
- **PR 2 (this work, chassis cluster):** downgraded the gate to a warning
  on the tolerant Load/SyncApply paths (boot safety — PR 1 had wired it
  strict there too); typed 13 chassis-cluster leaves (cluster-id, node,
  reth-count, heartbeat-interval/-threshold, reth-advertise-interval,
  takeover-hold-time, peer-fencing, RG node priority,
  gratuitous-arp-count, ip-monitoring global-weight / global-threshold /
  target weight) with runtime-derived, source-cited ranges. Deliberately
  NOT typed, with reasons in the `schema_chassis.go` comments: the
  `redundancy-group <id>` / RG-scoped `node <id>` instance-name slots
  (the walker's compiler-faithful contract consumes identity tokens
  without validation — typing them needs a new walker feature),
  `interface-monitor <if> weight <n>` (tokens pack inline into a
  `children==nil` leaf; typing the weight needs a children map, which
  would flip SetPath grouping), `control-ports` (not compiled), and the
  address/interface string leaves (IP value types arrive with the
  interfaces PR). Known residual: the hierarchical packed one-liner
  `node 0 priority <v>;` bypasses the gate (identity-token rule) even
  though `compileChassis` reads its inline tokens — pinned by
  `TestSchemaValidate_ChassisCluster_PackedOneLinerBypassesGate`.
- **PR 3 (this work):** the remaining converged-plan sections in one PR —
  (a) **interfaces**: `ValueIPAddress`/`ValueCIDR` value types, the typed
  KEY-slot walker feature, and 16 typed slots (mtu ×3, vlan-id,
  inner-vlan-id, family inet/inet6 `address` CIDR key slots, vrrp-group
  priority / advertise-interval / virtual-address, tunnel
  source/destination/ttl/key, wireguard listen-port /
  persistent-keepalive); (b) **firewall**: the `then forwarding-class`
  tree-based cross-ref for both families (dangling references reject at
  commit; same-commit definition + reference passes; `best-effort` is
  always resolvable; the other Junos default classes are deliberately NOT
  implicit — xpf's runtime does not define them); (c) **system/services**:
  22 typed slots (name-server, ssh root-login enum, the dataplane
  workers/ring-entries/poll-mode/rss-indirection/claim-host-tunables/
  netdev-budget/coalescence knobs, the rpm probe knobs, ip-monitoring
  hold-down / preferred-metric) plus the `validateMultiValueLeaf`
  block-list walker extension the deployed `name-server { 1.1.1.1; }`
  shape requires. Deliberately untyped, with reasons in
  `schema_system.go` / `schema_interfaces.go`:
  `unit <n>` / `vrrp-group <id>` instance ids (cross-referenced from other
  subsystems — one dedicated pass later), `track-interface priority-cost`
  (#1814 pre-walk owns it), `cpu-governor` (pass-through by design), dhcp
  client knobs, tunnel keepalives.
- **#1746:** added the `class-of-service schedulers <s>
  equal-flow-target-policy (slowest | mean | ideal-share)` typed enum
  leaf (ValueEnumOf + `ValidateEnum`, same recipe as the scheduler
  `priority` leaf): value-slot completion, flat-set commit-check
  rejection of unknown values, plus a strict-compile re-check for
  externally-assembled configs.
- **#1956 (chassis device-map):** added the bare-metal stable-identity
  managed allowlist under `chassis device-map` (a SIBLING of `cluster`, so
  per-node apply-groups compose). New value types `ValuePCIAddr` /
  `ValueMAC` with `ValidatePCIAddr` (canonical `DDDD:BB:DD.F`) /
  `ValidateMAC` (6-octet unicast, non-zero); a named-instance
  `interface <logical-name>` container using the typed-KEY-slot recipe
  (`keyValueType` + `ValidateDeviceMapLogicalName`) carrying typed `pci` /
  `mac` / `key` leaves; and the `unmapped-interface-policy` enum leaf
  (`leave-alone` default / `manage-down`). Compile lives in
  `compiler_chassis.go` (`compileDeviceMap`), independent of `cluster`
  (`compileChassis` compiles the device-map subtree even with no cluster —
  a standalone box). Cross-entry invariants that a single typed-leaf
  validator cannot express (duplicate logical name / PCI / MAC FATAL,
  RETH-member-must-be-PCI, FPC/node alignment in cluster mode) live in
  `validateDeviceMapStrict`, wired into the strict accumulator group in
  `compiler.go` and DOWNGRADED to a warning on the lenient load / peer-sync
  paths via the `lenientDeviceMap` compile opt (so a peer-node section with
  different hardware does not stall config sync — #1956 V-1). Device-map
  MODE is selected on `len(Entries) > 0`, never `DeviceMap != nil`, so an
  empty `device-map {}` block is positional mode (closes the
  empty-tree-compiles-non-nil trap). The pure identity resolver +
  host-NIC enumeration live in `pkg/devicemap` (shared by the daemon rename
  / pre-flight and the CLI `show`).
