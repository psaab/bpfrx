## 1. `show configuration` Sub-Path Completions

The `show configuration` command accepts a hierarchical path to narrow output to a
specific configuration section. Tab/`?` shows:

```

**Legend:**
- `>` prefix = container node (has sub-completions when you drill deeper)
- `+` prefix = leaf-list (e.g. `apply-groups` accepts multiple values)
- no prefix = leaf or command

Each sub-path can be drilled into further. For example `show configuration interfaces ?`
shows all configured interfaces by name, `show configuration security ?` shows all
security sub-sections, etc.

## 2. Pipe Filters (`|`)

After any `show configuration` command (with or without a sub-path), you can
pipe through one or more filters:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | ?
Possible completions:
  append               Append output text to file
  compare              Compare configuration changes with prior version
  count                Count occurrences
  display              Show additional kinds of information
  except               Show only text that does not match a pattern
  find                 Search for first occurrence of pattern
  hold                 Hold text without exiting the --More-- prompt
  last                 Display end of output only
  match                Show only text that matches a pattern
  no-more              Don't paginate output
  save                 Save output text to file
  suppress-zeros       Suppresses lines with zero values
  tee                  Write to standard output and file
  trim                 Trim specified number of columns from start of line
```

### 2.1 `| match <pattern>`

Shows only lines matching a regex pattern. Case-sensitive by default.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | match address | count
Count: 1135 lines
```

Argument:
```
Possible completions:
  <pattern>            Pattern to match against
```

### 2.2 `| except <pattern>`

Inverse of `match` -- shows lines that do NOT match the pattern.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | except address | count
Count: 4635 lines
```

Argument:
```
Possible completions:
  <pattern>            Pattern to avoid
```

### 2.3 `| find <pattern>`

Scrolls output to the first occurrence of the pattern, then shows everything
from that point forward.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | find "routing-options" | last 30
    ...
    static {
        route 0.0.0.0/0 next-table Comcast-GigabitPro.inet.0;
        ...
    }
    rib-groups { ... }
    forwarding-table { ... }
}
```

If the pattern is not found:
```
Count: 0 lines

Pattern not found
```

Argument:
```
Possible completions:
  <pattern>            Pattern to search for
```

### 2.4 `| count`

Counts the number of output lines. No arguments.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | count
Count: 5770 lines

claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display set | match reth0 | count
(chains with other filters)
```

Completions after `count`:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

### 2.5 `| last [<lines>]`

Shows the last N lines (default: all if no number given -- effectively shows
the tail of output).

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | last 20
```

Completions:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  <lines>              Number of lines from end of output to display
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

### 2.6 `| trim <columns>`

Removes the first N columns from each line. Useful for stripping indentation.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | trim 4 | match interface | count
Count: 80 lines
```

Argument:
```
Possible completions:
  <columns>            Number of columns to trim
```

### 2.7 `| no-more`

Disables pagination (equivalent to `set cli screen-length 0` for one command).
No arguments.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | no-more
```

Completions after `no-more`:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

### 2.8 `| hold`

Holds output at the `--More--` prompt without auto-exiting. No arguments.

### 2.9 `| suppress-zeros`

Suppresses lines with zero values. Primarily useful for `show` commands with
counters/statistics. For configuration, it has no visible effect.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | suppress-zeros | count
Count: 5770 lines    (same as without suppress-zeros)
```

### 2.10 `| save <filename>`

Saves output to a file or URL instead of displaying it.

```
Possible completions:
  <filename>           Output file name (or URL)
  routing-instance     Name of the routing_instance
  source-address       Local address to be used in originating the connection
```

Example: `show configuration | save /var/tmp/config.txt`

### 2.11 `| append <filename>`

Like `save`, but appends to an existing file.

```
Possible completions:
  <filename>           Output file name (or URL)
  routing-instance     Name of the routing instance
  source-address       Local address to be used in originating the connection
```

### 2.12 `| tee <filename>`

Writes to both standard output AND a file (like Unix `tee`).

```
Possible completions:
  <filename>           Output file name (or URL)
```

### 2.13 `| compare`

Compares the current configuration against a prior version.

```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  <filename>           Filename or URL of configuration file
  revision             Configuration revision to compare with
  rollback             Index of rollback configuration file (0..49)
  routing-instance     Name of the routing_instance
  source-address       Local address to be used in originating the connection
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

#### `| compare rollback <N>`

Compares against a specific rollback slot. The `?` completion shows timestamps:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | compare rollback ?
Possible completions:
  0                    2026-02-15 03:20:57 PST by ps via cli
  1                    2026-02-14 19:49:02 PST by ps via cli
  2                    2026-02-12 10:56:49 PST by ps via cli
  ...
  49                   2025-11-08 18:07:58 PST by ps via synchronize
```

Output uses unified diff format with `[edit ...]` context headers:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | compare rollback 1
[edit system login]
+    class config-viewer {
+        permissions [ view view-configuration ];
+        allow-commands "(show configuration.*)|(show version)|(show system information)";
+    }
[edit system login user claude]
-    class read-only;
+    class config-viewer;
```

`| compare` with no argument compares candidate vs. active (useful in
configuration mode).

---

## 3. `| display` Sub-Options

The `display` pipe filter changes the output format or adds metadata:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display ?
Possible completions:
  changed              Tag changes with junos:changed attribute (XML only)
  detail               Show configuration data detail
  inheritance          Show inherited configuration data and source group
  json                 Show output in JSON format
  mark-changed         Tag changes with junos:mark-changed attribute (XML only)
  max-depth            Maximum depth of configuration data
  max-version          Maximum version of configuration data
  omit                 Emit configuration statements with the 'omit' option
  rfc5952              Display IPv6 addresses as per RFC 5952 specifications
  set                  Show 'set' commands that create configuration
  xml                  Show output as XML tags
```

### 3.1 `| display set`

Converts hierarchical config into flat `set` commands. This is one of the most
commonly used display options.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display set
set system ntp server 2001:559:8585:ffff::4
set system ntp server 192.168.99.4
set system ntp threshold 400
set system ntp threshold action accept
```

Sub-options:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  explicit             Show 'set' commands explicitly for presence containers
  relative             Show 'set' commands relative to the current edit path
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

#### `| display set relative`

Omits the parent path prefix -- shows set commands relative to the current
section being viewed:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display set relative
set server 2001:559:8585:ffff::4
set server 192.168.99.4
set threshold 400
set threshold action accept
```

Compare to non-relative which includes the full path:
```
set system ntp server 2001:559:8585:ffff::4
```

#### `| display set explicit`

Same as `display set` but also includes set commands for "presence containers"
(configuration knobs that exist just by being present, with no child values).

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display set explicit
set system ntp server 2001:559:8585:ffff::4
set system ntp server 192.168.99.4
set system ntp threshold 400
set system ntp threshold action accept
```

(Difference is more visible for sections with presence containers like
`services { application-identification; }`)

### 3.2 `| display xml`

Outputs configuration in NETCONF-style XML format:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display xml
<rpc-reply xmlns:junos="http://xml.juniper.net/junos/24.4R1-S2.9/junos">
    <configuration junos:commit-seconds="1771154457"
                   junos:commit-localtime="2026-02-15 03:20:57 PST"
                   junos:commit-user="ps">
            <system>
                <ntp>
                    <server>
                        <name>2001:559:8585:ffff::4</name>
                    </server>
                    <server>
                        <name>192.168.99.4</name>
                    </server>
                    <threshold>
                        <value>400</value>
                        <action>accept</action>
                    </threshold>
                </ntp>
            </system>
    </configuration>
    <cli>
        <banner>{primary:node1}</banner>
    </cli>
</rpc-reply>
```

Sub-options:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  groups               Tag inherited data with the source group name
  interface-ranges     Tag inherited data with the source interface-range name
  no-export-path       Don't export parent path in the data
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

### 3.3 `| display json`

Outputs configuration in JSON format:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display json
{
    "configuration" : {
        "@" : {
            "junos:commit-seconds" : "1771154457",
            "junos:commit-localtime" : "2026-02-15 03:20:57 PST",
            "junos:commit-user" : "ps"
        },
        "system" : {
            "ntp" : {
                "server" : [
                {
                    "name" : "2001:559:8585:ffff::4"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "192.168.99.4"
                }
                ],
                "threshold" : {
                    "value" : 400,
                    "action" : "accept"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Sub-options (same as XML):
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  groups               Tag inherited data with the source group name
  interface-ranges     Tag inherited data with the source interface-range name
  no-export-path       Don't export parent path in the data
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

### 3.4 `| display inheritance`

Expands configuration groups (apply-groups) inline, showing inherited data and
its source group.

Line counts show the impact of inheritance expansion:
- Base config: 5,770 lines
- With inheritance: 10,574 lines (no-comments)
- With inheritance+comments: 15,123 lines (brief)
- With inheritance+defaults: 38,324 lines

Sub-options:
```
Possible completions:
  <[Enter]>            Execute this command
  brief                Display brief output
  defaults             Show default configuration values
  no-comments          Display inherited data without comments
  terse                Display inline comments
  when                 Specify additional conditions
  |                    Pipe through a command
```

#### `| display inheritance` (default)

Shows inherited config with `##` comment annotations showing the source group:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display inheritance
system {
    ##
    ## 'vsrx-bert' was inherited from group 'node1'
    ##
    host-name vsrx-bert;
    ...
}
```

#### `| display inheritance no-comments`

Same expansion but without the `##` source-group comments (10,574 lines).

#### `| display inheritance brief`

Shows inline comments instead of block comments (15,123 lines).

#### `| display inheritance terse`

Also displays inline comments, same line count as no-comments (10,574 lines).

#### `| display inheritance defaults`

Additionally shows default values that are not explicitly configured (38,324
lines -- massive expansion).

### 3.5 `| display detail`

Adds YANG module metadata, package info, daemon notify lists, and range
constraints as comments:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration system ntp | display detail
##
## ntp: Network Time Protocol services
## YANG module: junos-es-conf-system@2024-01-01.yang
## alias: network-time
## Daemon notify list: : none xntpd
## package: jkernel_usp
##
##
## Name or address of server
## Daemon notify list: : hostname-cached
##
server 2001:559:8585:ffff::4;
##
## Name or address of server
## Daemon notify list: : hostname-cached
##
server 192.168.99.4;
##
## threshold: Set the maximum threshold(sec) allowed for NTP adjustment
## YANG module: junos-es-conf-system@2024-01-01.yang
## Daemon notify list: : xntpd
## The maximum value(sec) allowed for NTP adjustment
## range: 1 .. 600
## action: Select actions for NTP abnormal adjustment
## YANG module: junos-es-conf-system@2024-01-01.yang
##
threshold 400 action accept;
```

Full config with `display detail` produces 33,814 lines.

### 3.6 `| display changed`

Tags configuration elements that have changed since the last commit with
`junos:changed` XML attributes. In text mode, the output looks similar to
normal config but with change markers in XML mode.

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display changed | count
Count: 5,801 lines
```

(Slightly more than base 5,770 due to change annotation overhead.)

### 3.7 `| display mark-changed`

Similar to `display changed` but uses the `junos:mark-changed` attribute
instead. Primarily useful in XML output mode to distinguish between changed
and unchanged nodes.

### 3.8 `| display max-depth <N>`

Truncates the config hierarchy to a maximum depth. Children beyond the
specified depth are collapsed to `{ ... }`.

#### `| display max-depth 1`

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display max-depth 1
version 24.4R1-S2.9;
groups {
    node0 { ... }
    node1 { ... }
    default-deny-template { ... }
    ...
}
system {
    root-authentication { ... }
    commit persist-groups-inheritance;
    login { ... }
    services { ... }
    time-zone America/Los_Angeles;
    no-redirects;
    ...
}
security {
    log { ... }
    ike { ... }
    ipsec { ... }
    nat { ... }
    policies { ... }
    zones { ... }
}
interfaces {
    ge-0/0/0 { ... }
    reth0 { ... }
    reth1 { ... }
    ...
}
```

#### `| display max-depth 2`

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration | display max-depth 2
groups {
    node0 {
        system { ... }
        interfaces { ... }
    }
    ...
}
system {
    login {
        class config-viewer { ... }
        user claude { ... }
        ...
    }
    services {
        ssh { ... }
        dns { ... }
        web-management { ... }
    }
    ...
}
interfaces {
    reth0 {
        description "Comcast Gigabit Pro";
        redundant-ether-options { ... }
        unit 0 { ... }
    }
    reth1 {
        description "vSRX to US-16-XG";
        vlan-tagging;
        redundant-ether-options { ... }
        unit 1 { ... }
        unit 50 { ... }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

This is extremely useful for getting a high-level overview of a large
configuration.

### 3.9 `| display max-version <N>`

Filters configuration to show only statements at or below a certain schema
version. Rarely used.

```
Possible completions:
  <version>            Version value
```

### 3.10 `| display omit`

Emits configuration statements that have the `omit` option set. In practice,
output looks identical to normal config for most configurations.

### 3.11 `| display rfc5952`

Formats IPv6 addresses according to RFC 5952 (canonical representation with
zero suppression). Example output:

```
claude@vsrx-bert> show configuration interfaces reth1 unit 1 | display rfc5952
family inet6 {
    address fe80::351/6;
    address fd35:1940:27:1::1/6;
    address 2001:559:8585:fff1::1/6;
    address 2602:fd41:70:fff1::1/6;
    ...
}
```

**Note:** On this version (24.4R1-S2.9), the prefix lengths appear truncated
(showing `/6` instead of `/64`). This may be a display bug in the
terminal-width handling of the CLI.

---

## 4. Pipe Chaining

Multiple pipe filters can be chained together. Each filter processes the output
of the previous one, left to right:

```
show configuration | display set | match reth0 | no-more
show configuration | display set | match reth0 | count
show configuration | trim 4 | match interface | count
show configuration | find "routing-options" | last 30
show configuration interfaces | display set | except reth1 | count
show configuration security zones | display set | match interface | count
show configuration | display set | match "security nat" | count
```

**Common chaining patterns:**

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `\| display set \| match <pat>` | Find specific set commands |
| `\| display set \| match <pat> \| count` | Count matching set commands |
| `\| display set \| except <pat> \| count` | Count non-matching set commands |
| `\| match <pat> \| count` | Count matching lines in hierarchical output |
| `\| find <pat> \| last <N>` | Show last N lines starting from pattern |
| `\| display xml \| no-more` | Full XML output without pagination |
| `\| display set \| save /var/tmp/f.txt` | Save flat config to file |
| `\| display inheritance no-comments \| display set` | Flat set with groups expanded |

---

## 5. Sub-Path + Display Combinations

You can combine sub-path narrowing with display formats:

```
# Just the interfaces section, as set commands, relative paths
show configuration interfaces | display set relative

# Security section, one level deep
show configuration security | display max-depth 1

# NTP section in JSON
show configuration system ntp | display json

# NTP section in XML
show configuration system ntp | display xml

# Specific interface, with YANG detail
show configuration interfaces reth0 | display detail
```

---

## 6. Output Line Counts by Format

For the same configuration (5,770 lines in hierarchical format):

| Format | Line Count |
|--------|-----------|
| `show configuration` (hierarchical) | 5,770 |
| `\| display set` | ~5,800+ |
| `\| display changed` | 5,801 |
| `\| display xml` | 9,901 |
| `\| display json` | 10,655 |
| `\| display inheritance no-comments` | 10,574 |
| `\| display inheritance terse` | 10,574 |
| `\| display inheritance brief` | 15,123 |
| `\| display detail` | 33,814 |
| `\| display inheritance defaults` | 38,324 |

---

## 7. Interesting Behaviors and Notes

### 7.1 Comment Annotations

Junos adds `##` comments in the output for various conditions:

- `## SECRET-DATA` -- passwords and keys are redacted
- `## 'X' is not defined` -- forward references to undefined objects
- `## Last commit: <timestamp> by <user>` -- commit header
- `inactive:` prefix -- deactivated config stanzas
- `## Warning: 'ssh-dsa' is deprecated` -- deprecation notices

### 7.2 `{ ... }` Collapse in max-depth

When `display max-depth` truncates children, it uses `{ ... }` notation.
Leaf values at the visible depth are shown normally:

```
reth0 {
    description "Comcast Gigabit Pro";    <-- leaf shown
    redundant-ether-options { ... }        <-- container collapsed
    unit 0 { ... }                         <-- container collapsed
}
```

### 7.3 `deactivate` in Set Output

Deactivated configuration shows as `deactivate` instead of `set`:

```
set groups node0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.50.210/24
deactivate groups node0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.50.210/24
```

### 7.4 Wildcard Groups

Configuration groups can use `<*>` wildcards that match any value:

```
groups {
    default-deny-template {
        security {
            policies {
                from-zone <*> to-zone <*> {
                    policy default-deny { ... }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 7.5 Rollback History

The `compare rollback` completion shows full commit history with timestamps,
user, and commit method (cli, junoscript, synchronize):

```
  0    2026-02-15 03:20:57 PST by ps via cli
  1    2026-02-14 19:49:02 PST by ps via cli
  ...
  49   2025-11-08 18:07:58 PST by ps via synchronize
```

Up to 50 rollback slots (0-49) are available.

### 7.6 Inactive Prefix

Inactive configuration elements are prefixed with `inactive:` in hierarchical
format and shown as `deactivate` commands in set format:

```
# Hierarchical:
inactive: stream promtail-syslog { ... }

# Set format:
deactivate security log stream promtail-syslog
```

### 7.7 `display set relative` vs. `display set`

`relative` removes the parent path from set commands. Particularly useful when
you are deep in a sub-path:

```
# Full path:
show configuration interfaces | display set
set interfaces reth0 description "Comcast Gigabit Pro"
set interfaces reth0 unit 0 family inet address 50.220.171.30/30 primary

# Relative:
show configuration interfaces | display set relative
set reth0 description "Comcast Gigabit Pro"
set reth0 unit 0 family inet address 50.220.171.30/30 primary
```

### 7.8 JSON Format Details

The JSON output wraps everything under `"configuration"` with commit metadata
in the `"@"` key:

```json
{
    "configuration" : {
        "@" : {
            "junos:commit-seconds" : "1771154457",
            "junos:commit-localtime" : "2026-02-15 03:20:57 PST",
            "junos:commit-user" : "ps"
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

Lists are represented as JSON arrays. For example, NTP servers become:
```json
"server" : [
    { "name" : "2001:559:8585:ffff::4" },
    { "name" : "192.168.99.4" }
]
```

### 7.9 Completion Symbol Meanings

In the `?` help output:
- `>` = container/branch node (drill deeper)
- `+` = leaf-list (accepts multiple values, e.g. `apply-groups`)
- `<[Enter]>` = command can be executed as-is
- `<pattern>`, `<filename>`, `<depth>` = required argument placeholder
- `|` = pipe to another filter
