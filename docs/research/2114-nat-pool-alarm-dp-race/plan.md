# #2114 (residual): publish `d.dp` through one synchronized accessor — plan-of-action

- **Status**: DRAFT v7 — r6 findings folded (Codex NEEDS-REVISION 2M/5m;
  AGY NEEDS-REVISION 1M/1m — SAME major found independently; Claude SMR
  NEEDS-REVISION 2B/1M/3m); pending convergence review r7
- **Issue**: psaab/xpf#2114 (OPEN; `bug`, `audit`)
- **Branch**: `research/2114-nat-pool-alarm-dp-race` (plan docs only — NO
  production code in `/research`)
- **Base**: origin/master @ `ed6999000`
- **Mode**: `/research` — stops at PLAN-READY. Implementation requires manual
  `/engineer 2114`.
- **Revision history**: v1 @ `1d62be758` (initial). v2 @ `61568128f` (r1:
  deleted false invariants, deleted A2, canary redesign, sampler-only scope,
  snapshot boundaries, table regeneration). v3 @ `f0c1605cd` (r2: kind-gated
  typed-nil, four-link exclusion, STRUCTURAL sampler-only via
  `CachedStatusProvider`, real-sampler barrier, untruncated table). v4 @
  `e9ac48db1` (r3: two-sided barrier, exact 134 count, RACE-1 scoped,
  all-kind nil gate, honest Option D). v5 @ `ee5f54484` (r4: RACE-3
  documented; readiness `:202` into RACE-1; residuals). v6 @ `ee270c729`
  (r5: startup-readiness gate v1 for the pre-existing vrrpMgr nil-deref /
  bootstrap-armed defects). v7: r6 convergence — gate REDESIGNED as an
  exactly-once startup outcome (`startupDone` closed on every exit path +
  `startupOK` set only on success) after both reviewers independently found
  the v6 select's failure leg leaks the timer goroutine (`d.daemonCtx`
  never cancels); the four-link exclusion's link (iv) is scoped to
  current-version records after Codex's verified cross-upgrade
  counterexample (legacy first-commit cluster record → live cluster runtime
  + `enterBootstrapMode` coexistence); gate tests strengthened to pin
  applySem-freedom and a deterministic startup seam; table exposure cells
  made consistent; constructor initialization + lock-order contract
  comments + risk-table additions.

## 1. Issue framing

#2114 originally reported that the #2079 NAT pool-utilization-alarm monitor
(PR #2109) ran a 10 s sampler goroutine reading the daemon's `d.dp` interface
field with no synchronization, racing the bootstrap-exit `d.dp = nil` write on
a dataplane-arm failure. PR #2116 (merged) closed the *narrow* monitor race
(`atomic.Pointer` monitor, `!inBootstrap()` gating, rollback discard, `-race`
tests).

The issue remains OPEN on the Paladin-audit **residual**: the field `d.dp
dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane` (`pkg/daemon/daemon.go:73`) is a plain interface
field with **5 writers** and **129 read sites** in `pkg/daemon` (134
non-comment greppable references total — exact enumeration in §5.4), most
of them unsynchronized or synchronized only by non-local reasoning. Required closeout (verbatim):

1. Publish the runtime dataplane through one synchronized/immutable accessor
   used by **every reader and writer**, or bind the sampler to an immutable
   backend and restart/replace it transactionally.
2. Eliminate direct unsynchronized reads in the forwarding-status adapters
   and the bootstrap writer.
3. Add a deterministic `-race` regression covering sampler ticks/status calls
   concurrent with bootstrap-exit `Start` failure, plus backend-type
   transition assertions.
4. Audit all remaining `d.dp` background/request readers so this does not
   become another per-monitor patch.

## 2. Honest scope/value framing

This is a correctness/robustness change, not a performance change. There are
no cycles/MB/retransmits to win back. The win, at absolute scale:

- **Eliminates a real data race on a multiword Go interface value** on three
  structurally distinct, reviewer-verified interleavings:
  - **RACE-1 (HA boot publication — no bootstrap needed, WATCHER-CHAIN
    ONLY)**: `initManagers` starts the cluster event watcher
    (`daemon_run_bringup.go:203`; the election inside `UpdateConfig` at :181
    can synchronously enqueue the initial transition) BEFORE
    `setupDataplaneAndInitialConfig` assigns `d.dp` (:448/:469/:497). The
    watcher's event-handler chain reads `d.dp` at
    `daemon_ha.go:297,299,337,348,362,367` AND — via the promotion/demotion
    blackhole paths (`daemon_ha.go:311` → `removeBlackholeRoutes`
    :1124; `:359-360` → `:1064-1066`) — at
    `daemon_ha_userspace_readiness.go:202`, with no happens-before edge to
    the assignment. **Scope note (r3/r4)**: this is the ONLY pre-publication
    reader chain on the CLUSTER side — every other HA goroutine
    (`startClusterComms` `daemon_run.go:396`, VRRP watcher :578, reconcile
    :582, session sync `daemon_ha_sync.go:790`) starts AFTER publication
    and is goroutine-start HB-safe against the boot writer. (The recovered
    confirm-timer chain is the SEPARATE pre-publication entrant documented
    as RACE-3 below.)
  - **RACE-2 (bootstrap-exit arm failure — standalone/bootstrap nodes)**:
    `runBootstrapExitStartup` writes `d.dp = nil`
    (`daemon_run_naming.go:234`) on the apply goroutine under `d.applySem`
    while the 1 Hz forwarding-status sampler, the standalone userspace
    event stream (`daemon_ha_userspace_stream.go:122`, launched when
    `d.cluster == nil` at `daemon_run.go:365`), the REST simulator probe
    (`daemon_run_servers.go:409-417`), the neighbor listener
    (`daemon_neighbor_listener.go:303-310,469-476`), and the shutdown
    final-stats/Close/Teardown reads (`daemon_run_shutdown.go:214-229` —
    applySem is released immediately at :50) read `d.dp` unsynchronized.
  - **RACE-3 (recovered commit-confirmed rollback timer vs boot
    publication — any restart inside a confirm window)**: the rollback
    executor is registered at daemon init, before any startup phase
    (`daemon_run.go:136`); phase-1 `Store.Load` re-arms a pending
    commit-confirmed timer for the remaining window — arbitrarily short
    (`store_persist.go:251`); the timer goroutine fires the executor
    (`store_commit.go:819` → `daemon_apply_commit.go:629`, taking
    `d.applySem`) and the rollback reads `d.dp` (`bootstrap.go:472-473` on
    the first-commit path; the full apply pipeline — from
    `daemon_apply_dataplane.go:98` through `daemon_apply_interfaces.go:42`,
    `daemon_apply_tail.go:491`, `daemon_apply_routing.go:367`, the
    scheduler, ipmon, policy-invalidate — on a non-nil rollback) WHILE the
    phase-3 boot writers (`daemon_run_bringup.go:448,464,469,497`) assign
    `d.dp` WITHOUT holding applySem. The executor's semaphore orders
    apply-vs-apply but never met the boot writes. Precondition is mundane:
    operator issued `commit confirmed` and rebooted inside the window.
    **r5 consequence discovery (pre-existing, worse than the field race)**:
    the same early fire can run the apply tail's unconditional
    `d.vrrpMgr.UpdateInstances` (`daemon_apply_tail.go:50`) BEFORE
    `d.vrrpMgr` is constructed (`daemon_run_bringup.go:219`) — a nil-deref
    panic on boot; and on the first-commit branch `enterBootstrapMode`
    (`bootstrap.go:322` Store(true) + `:472-473` Teardown) can land between
    the boot's `inBootstrap()` check (`daemon_run_bringup.go:490`) and its
    `d.dp.Start` (:494), arming the dataplane inside bootstrap mode. These
    are DISPATCH-ORDERING defects the atomic cell cannot fix — they need
    the startup-readiness gate (§4 A1, work item G).
  A torn `(type, data)` read can panic the daemon process (fatal on a
  firewall) or yield an inconsistent type assertion.
- **Bootstrap/cluster mutual exclusion — scoped to current-version records
  (r2 four-link proof, r6-scoped)**: HA background readers cannot coexist
  with the RACE-2 writer on configurations produced by CURRENT-version
  guards: (i) compile-failed boot ⇒ `ActiveConfig() == nil`
  (`daemon_run_bringup.go:287`); (ii) `d.cluster` is constructed EXACTLY
  ONCE, at boot, only from a non-nil active cluster config
  (`daemon_run_bringup.go:164`, documented `cluster_topology_preflight.go:117`);
  (iii) standalone↔cluster topology transitions are rejected at commit
  (`daemon_apply_commit.go:551-557` `clusterTopologyCommitPreflight`) and a
  peer SyncApply that would transition returns BEFORE `applyConfigLocked`
  (`daemon_apply_commit.go:364-379`); (iv) `enterBootstrapMode` fires only
  for a nil rollback target (`daemon_apply_commit.go:650-652`), which cannot
  follow a config that had a live cluster runtime.
  **r6 boundary (verified counterexample)**: link (iv) fails on the
  cross-upgrade path. A pre-topology-guard build allowed a first confirmed
  standalone→cluster commit; that commit marks the store ever-committed AT
  COMMIT (`store_commit.go:458-461`) while persisting `FirstCommit=true`;
  recovery accepts an empty legacy `GuardedHash` (`store_persist.go:149-159`)
  and reconstructs `confirmPrevCfg=nil` solely from `FirstCommit`
  (`store_persist.go:241-242`); the ACTIVE cluster config constructs
  `d.cluster` at boot (`daemon_run_bringup.go:164`); a later timeout rolls
  into `enterBootstrapMode` — which does NOT stop cluster comms
  (`bootstrap.go:321-478`). Result: bootstrap-with-live-cluster-runtime,
  and a later corrected re-exit can run the RACE-2 writer against live HA
  readers. On current-version records this cannot happen (the preflight
  rejects the topology add), and a never-committed marker cannot coexist
  with a same-version committed cluster config. **Consequence**: the plan
  does NOT rely on the exclusion for safety — it converts every reader
  uniformly, which covers the legacy path by construction. Behavior-level
  hardening for the legacy path (guard recovery against FirstCommit+cluster
  records, or stop cluster comms in `enterBootstrapMode` when
  `d.cluster != nil`) is out of scope — follow-up issue at /engineer time
  (§10, §11 OQ7).
- **Converts non-local safety arguments into local ones.** r1-r4 review
  proved three of the plan's own non-local arguments false as stated. One
  publication mechanism makes each of the 129 read sites locally correct
  and keeps it correct when the next runtime writer appears.
- **Cost**: ~134 production references + ~110 test sites (32 selector-style
  + ~79 `Daemon{dp: ...}` keyed literals) in `pkg/daemon`; 3 files in
  `pkg/fwdstatus`; the field is package-private, zero references outside
  `pkg/daemon`. No Rust/helper/FFI changes; no packet-path changes.

*If reviewers conclude the race windows are too narrow to justify the churn,
PLAN-KILL is an acceptable verdict.*

## 3. What's already shipped / partially batched

- **PR #2116 (merged)** — the narrow monitor fix: `d.natPoolAlarm
  atomic.Pointer[natpoolalarm.Monitor]`, lifecycle helpers
  (`daemon_natpoolalarm.go:100-129`), `!inBootstrap()` gating, rollback
  stop+discard (`bootstrap.go:334`), `SetTickForTest` seam, three `-race`
  tests. Composed with, not replaced by, this plan.
- **eBPF/DPDK retirements (#1476/#1527)** — one live backend type
  (`*dpuserspace.LegacyDataPlaneAdapter`, plus test fakes). The only live
  `d.dp` transition on master is `non-nil → nil` (terminal — nothing
  re-constructs the backend; `buildRuntimeDataPlane` has exactly one caller,
  `daemon_run_bringup.go:421`).
- **#1922 bootstrap mode + #5840 topology preflight** — the RACE-2 writer
  context and the four-link exclusion above.
- **#5868** — `enterBootstrapMode` best-effort rollback; keeps the dataplane
  object (`bootstrap.go:472-475`).
- **`runtime_probes.go` probe-interface idiom** — preserved by the accessor
  shape.
- **#3970 `CachedStatus`** — the sampler's only dataplane call; no
  control-socket rate change.

## 4. Multiple path options (explicit)

### Option A1 (RECOMMENDED): atomic publication cell + uniform accessor, compiler-enforced full conversion

Replace `dp dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane` (`daemon.go:73`) with an atomic cell
and route **all** references through one accessor pair. The field's *type*
changes, so every direct `d.dp` read/write fails to compile — conversion
completeness is compiler-enforced (old selectors, aliases, keyed literals,
embedding, method values; external packages cannot name the unexported
field). r2 verification (Codex): no `package daemon_test` bypasses, no
reflective/unsafe field lookup, no alternate receiver alias, no production
method-value capture exists.

```go
// daemon.go — #2114: single synchronized publication point for the runtime
// dataplane. nil cell == no dataplane (NoDataplane mode, create failure, or
// an arm-failure teardown). The slot is immutable once stored.
type dpSlot struct{ v dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane }

dpCell atomic.Pointer[dpSlot]

// dataplane returns the currently published runtime dataplane, or nil.
// One atomic load; safe from any goroutine. Callers that nil-check AND use
// the value must load ONCE into a local (§5.3 snapshot boundaries).
func (d *Daemon) dataplane() dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane {
    if s := d.dpCell.Load(); s != nil {
        return s.v
    }
    return nil
}

// setDataplane publishes dp (nil clears). The kind-gated typed-nil check
// keeps a non-nil interface wrapping a nil value out of the cell WITHOUT
// panicking on non-nillable kinds (r2: reflect.IsNil panics on struct
// values) and WITHOUT missing non-pointer nillable kinds (r3: named
// Chan/Func/Map/Slice types can have methods — in-repo precedent
// pkg/dataplane/userspace/wire_uint8list.go:32). RuntimeDataPlane has no
// pointer-only constraint and the registry (pkg/dataplane/dataplane.go:152,
// 215) returns arbitrary constructor results unchecked.
func (d *Daemon) setDataplane(dp dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane) {
    if dp == nil {
        d.dpCell.Store(nil)
        return
    }
    v := reflect.ValueOf(dp)
    switch v.Kind() {
    case reflect.Chan, reflect.Func, reflect.Map,
        reflect.Pointer, reflect.Slice, reflect.UnsafePointer:
        if v.IsNil() {
            d.dpCell.Store(nil)
            return
        }
    }
    d.dpCell.Store(&dpSlot{v: dp})
}
```

Why `atomic.Pointer[dpSlot]`, not `atomic.Value`: `Store(nil)` panics and
mixed concrete types panic; the cell must hold "interface or absent". One
allocation per Store (≤5 per daemon lifetime), zero per read; matches the
#2116 precedent.

**Canary redesign (explicit work item)**: the retype breaks
`TestDaemonRuntimeEntryPointUsesRuntimeDataPlane`
(`pkg/dataplane/retirement_boundary_canary_test.go:1711`, helper
:3314-3348), which requires a Daemon field NAMED `dp` of AST type exactly
`dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane`. The /engineer pass must:
  1. extend the matcher to accept the new shape — field
     `dpCell atomic.Pointer[dpSlot]` AND a `dpSlot` struct whose `v` field is
     `dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane`. `atomic.Pointer[dpSlot]` parses as
     `*ast.IndexExpr` (generic instantiation), which the canary's
     `canaryExprString` renderer (:3352-3360) does not yet handle — add
     `*ast.IndexExpr`/`*ast.IndexListExpr` support (r2 AGY MINOR 1). The
     guarded boundary is preserved semantically: the daemon's dataplane IS a
     `RuntimeDataPlane`, now published atomically.
  2. add a NEW AST canary in `pkg/daemon/daemon_dp_canary_test.go` (named
     per r2 AGY MINOR 2) forbidding direct `dpCell` /
     `.dpCell.Load()/.Store()` references outside the accessor definitions
     and the field declaration — a future package-local bypass then fails
     `make test-go`.
  3. give the redesigned canary its own unit coverage: it must FAIL on a
     raw `dp dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane` field AND on an unguarded `dpCell`
     access (both directions asserted).

**Work item G — startup-readiness gate for the rollback executor (r5 B1,
r6-redesigned; closes the pre-existing dispatch-ordering defect the RACE-3
audit exposed).** The recovered commit-confirmed timer can fire before
`initManagers` completes (§2 RACE-3), which today can nil-deref
`d.vrrpMgr` (`daemon_apply_tail.go:50` vs construction at
`daemon_run_bringup.go:219`) and can arm the dataplane inside bootstrap
mode (`daemon_run_bringup.go:490` check vs `:494` Start, interleaved with
`enterBootstrapMode`). Design — one exactly-once startup OUTCOME, not a
one-arm channel (r6: `d.daemonCtx` is the raw, never-cancelled parent
(#5807, `daemon_run.go:64-87`; production passes `context.Background()`),
so a `select` on it has no live arm on a failed/aborted startup and the
timer goroutine would leak forever; and closing a ready-channel on the
failure path would wrongly authorize rollback against partial
initialization):

```go
// daemon.go — the startup outcome. startupDone is initialized in the
// production constructor (daemon.go:1086-1108) BEFORE the executor
// registration (daemon_run.go:136) — a nil channel would hang the
// executor even on success. It is closed EXACTLY once on EVERY
// startup-exit path; startupOK is stored true ONLY at the success
// linearization point.
startupDone chan struct{}
startupOK   atomic.Bool

// executeConfirmedRollback (daemon_apply_commit.go:629) — wait for the
// outcome, then check it, THEN take applySem. Gate-before-applySem is
// mandatory: the boot apply holds applySem across startup, so gating
// while holding it would deadlock startup.
<-d.startupDone
if !d.startupOK.Load() {
    slog.Warn("commit-confirmed rollback abandoned: daemon startup did not complete; " +
        "the persisted confirm record is re-resolved on the next boot (expired-window path)")
    return
}
```

- **Success close**: at the linearization point — after the last late
  manager initialization (`daemon_run.go:435-511`) and BEFORE exposing
  HTTP (`:587`) / gRPC (`:599`): `d.startupOK.Store(true);
  close(d.startupDone)`. A rollback dispatched after it is semantically
  identical to a remote commit arriving at first server contact (already
  tolerated), and no apply runs concurrent with server construction.
- **Failure close**: the abort/phase-error return (`daemon_run.go:176-178`,
  via a deferred close registered before `runStartupOrAbort`) closes
  `startupDone` WITHOUT setting OK — the executor wakes and abandons. No
  leak on any path; no context-cancellation semantics involved.
- **Signal-during-PHASE-5**: a rollback dispatched while a shutdown is
  pending is ordinary apply-vs-shutdown behavior (applySem-ordered,
  `daemon_run_shutdown.go:50`) — not a defect.
- **Test-fixture migration**: existing executor fixtures
  (`rollback_resync_test.go:31`, `bootstrap_rollback_test.go:24`)
  construct `Daemon` directly and must initialize the outcome
  (closed + OK) — a nil gate must never silently mean "ready".
- **Contract comments**: the "acquires applySem FIRST" lock-order notes at
  `store_commit.go:327-334` and `daemon_apply_commit.go:611-628` are
  reworded for the gate-before-applySem order.
- Store-internal fallback (`performAutoRollback`, `store_commit.go:822-823`)
  is untouched — it is store-state-only, no daemon managers. (Executor
  dispatch is `store_commit.go:821`.)
- Scope note: small companion fix inside the same PR (~40 LoC + tests).
  Shipping the publication fix while leaving a KNOWN boot-panic would
  contradict issue requirement #4's spirit. Both r6 reviewers recommend
  KEEP-in-PR (Codex: possibly as a separate prerequisite commit in the
  same stack). r7 open question 6 confirms.

**fwdstatus adapter: STRUCTURALLY sampler-only (r2 M1 — Codex's structural
argument adopted over AGY's comment-level one, per this repo's
compile-time-invariant discipline).** The sampler only ever calls
`CachedStatus` (`sampler.go:113-125`); `fwdstatus.DataPlaneAccessor`
requires only `IsLoaded`+`GetMapStats` (`builder.go:35-41`); `Build` keys
backend identity on `Status()` PRESENCE (`builder.go:116-123`) and maps a
Status error to `StateUnknown` (:219). Therefore:

- `pkg/fwdstatus` gains
  `type CachedStatusProvider interface { CachedStatus() (userspace.ProcessStatus, bool) }`;
  `NewSampler` takes it (was `DataPlaneAccessor`); `Sampler.dp` retypes;
  `sample()` calls `s.dp.CachedStatus()` directly (the per-tick type
  assertion at :113 is deleted). 3 files touched: `sampler.go`,
  `sampler_test.go` (the `countingAccessor` fake already has
  `CachedStatus`), and the daemon adapter file. `Build` untouched.
- The daemon adapter collapses to a SINGLE method, probing the CURRENT
  dataplane per call:

```go
// forwardingStatusDaemonDataPlane is the daemon's sampler-only dataplane
// adapter (#2114). It deliberately does NOT satisfy
// fwdstatus.DataPlaneAccessor and has no Status method: Build keys backend
// identity on Status() presence (builder.go:116-123), so this type can
// never be misrouted into a Build path.
type forwardingStatusDaemonDataPlane struct{ daemon *Daemon }

func (a forwardingStatusDaemonDataPlane) CachedStatus() (dpuserspace.ProcessStatus, bool) {
    if a.daemon == nil {
        return dpuserspace.ProcessStatus{}, false
    }
    return a.daemon.userspaceDataplaneCachedStatus() // one d.dataplane() load; userspaceCachedStatusProbe
}
```

- `forwardingStatusDataplane()` now returns `fwdstatus.CachedStatusProvider`
  (nil iff `d.opts.NoDataplane`); `IsLoaded`/`GetMapStats`/`Status` leave
  the daemon adapter (verified: no production callers — the gRPC/CLI Build
  paths construct their OWN adapters per request from boot-captured probes,
  `server_show_forwarding.go:21-22`, `cli_show_chassis.go:59-60`, and are
  untouched); the now-dead `userspaceDataplaneStatus()` helper is removed;
  `userspaceDataplaneCachedStatus()` is retained.

### Option B: eliminate the writer (write-once `d.dp` + degraded adapter)

REJECTED: its "write once before goroutines" premise is already false
(RACE-1); it re-audits every `d.dp == nil` check for nil-vs-degraded
semantics; it changes config-only-mode apply behavior
(`daemon_apply_dataplane.go:139` — blackhole-relevant); it leaves the
unsynchronized-read pattern latent for any future writer.

### Option C: `sync.RWMutex`-guarded accessor

Viable (an accessor that copies under RLock and unlocks before returning
cannot deadlock — r1 correction stands). Not chosen: #2116 `atomic.Pointer`
precedent, cheaper reads, hold-nothing-by-construction.

### Option D: immutable owner + atomic presence flag (r1 addition, REJECTED)

Write-once `dpOwner` + `atomic.Bool dpPresent`; arm failure clears only the
flag. It cleanly represents never-constructed (`owner == nil && !present`)
vs cleared (`owner != nil && !present`), and the immutable owner RETAINS
identity for post-clear introspection (`%T` logging, shutdown final stats)
— a genuine advantage over A1's nil-slot (which discards identity on clear).
Rejected on its real weaknesses: (a) two-word state requires every reader
to follow a flag-then-load ordering discipline with zero compiler help (A1
makes the correct read the only read; D would need its own canary to be
enforced); (b) the write-once premise forbids backend REPLACEMENT by
construction — a future hot-swap/re-arm with a fresh object cannot be
expressed, whereas A1 republishes trivially; (c) it deviates from the
merged #2116 `atomic.Pointer` precedent. A1 carries identity+presence in
ONE atomic word and is the simpler invariant to hold.

### Option E: per-consumer lifecycle gating

REJECTED: the per-monitor patch pattern issue requirement #4 rules out;
cannot cover request-goroutine readers.

### The honest fork

**A1 as specified, or PLAN-KILL** (accept both races as documented
known-issues and rebind only the sampler per transition — fails issue
requirements #1/#4 and leaves RACE-1 open). v1's A2 (raw field + cell
coexistence) is deleted as incoherent (r1 B3).

## 5. Concrete design (A1)

### 5.1 New/changed types

- `pkg/daemon/daemon.go`: `dpSlot`, `dpCell atomic.Pointer[dpSlot]`
  replacing `dp`; `dataplane()` / `setDataplane()` (kind-gated); field doc
  comment mirroring the `natPoolAlarm` contract (`daemon.go:211-223`).
- `pkg/daemon/daemon_forwarding_status.go`: single-method sampler-only
  adapter (§4 A1); `userspaceDataplaneStatus()` removed;
  `userspaceCachedStatusProbe` retained; `forwardingStatusDataplane()`
  returns `fwdstatus.CachedStatusProvider`, nil iff `d.opts.NoDataplane`.
- `pkg/fwdstatus/sampler.go`: `CachedStatusProvider` interface; `NewSampler`
  + `Sampler.dp` retyped; `sample()` direct call.
- `pkg/dataplane/retirement_boundary_canary_test.go`: matcher extension
  (incl. `*ast.IndexExpr` renderer support).
- `pkg/daemon/daemon_dp_canary_test.go` (new): dpCell-access AST canary.
- No other package touched. `pkg/grpcapi`, `pkg/cli`, `pkg/api` untouched.

### 5.2 Writer conversion (5 sites — complete, both reviewers verified)

| Site | Context | After |
|---|---|---|
| `daemon_run_bringup.go:448` (DPDK retired) | boot, Run goroutine | `d.setDataplane(nil)` |
| `daemon_run_bringup.go:464` (eBPF retired) | boot, Run goroutine | `d.setDataplane(nil)` |
| `daemon_run_bringup.go:469` (construct) | boot, Run goroutine — RACE-1 window | `d.setDataplane(dp)` |
| `daemon_run_bringup.go:497` (Start fail) | boot, Run goroutine | `d.setDataplane(nil)` |
| `daemon_run_naming.go:234` (bootstrap-exit arm fail) | apply goroutine, `d.applySem` — RACE-2 | `d.setDataplane(nil)` |

### 5.3 Per-site snapshot boundaries (normative conversion rules)

1. **Per-tick loop readers** (HA watchdog `daemon_ha_sync.go:750`,
   reconcile loops, neighbor listener): ONE load per tick/iteration before
   any per-element loop (watchdog: one load shared across the RG loop — not
   per-RG, not a lifetime capture).
2. **Spawn-gated loops** (`daemon_ha_sync.go:733`): gate check is one load;
   the loop body loads per tick per rule 1.
3. **Multi-use straight-line sites** (`daemon_run_naming.go:230-248`): ONE
   local for nil-check + `Start` + seeding; `setDataplane(nil)` only on the
   failure branch.
4. **Two-assertion sites** (`daemon_neighbor_listener.go:469-476`):
   provider and `indexEnumerator` derive from ONE load.
5. **Snapshot-per-operation** (fence `daemon_ha_sync.go:1286,1297`,
   `warmNeighborCache` `daemon_ha.go:1521-1545`, shutdown
   `daemon_run_shutdown.go:161-173` and :214-229 — one snapshot for the
   HA-clear block, a SECOND for final-stats+Close/Teardown, matching
   today's two separate reads).
6. **Capture-once at goroutine start** (`daemon_gc.go:22`,
   `daemon_ha_userspace_stream.go:67,122,259`): exactly one load at start —
   preserves today's semantics deliberately.
7. **Per-request / per-callback readers** (REST
   `PolicySchedulerActiveStateFn`, NAT pool sampler closure, health, the
   full-resync exporter read at `daemon_ha_userspace_stream.go:235`): one
   load per invocation.
8. **Apply-path readers under `d.applySem`**: same load-once rules; the
   accessor is lock-free, orthogonal to applySem.
9. **`%T` logging** (`daemon_ha_sync.go:311`): `%T` of the loaded value —
   same output.

### 5.4 Reader audit table (issue requirement #4 — untruncated, exact)

**134 executable production references** (163 greppable lines over
`pkg/daemon/*.go` minus `_test.go` matching `'d\.dp\b|a\.daemon\.dp\b'`,
minus 29 full-line comments): **5 writers + 129 readers**. Classes:
**W** = writer; **APPLY** = applySem-serialized reader; **BOOT-SYNC** =
Run-goroutine read before any server can deliver a commit; **CONCURRENT** =
background/request-goroutine reader. Reachability: RACE-2 reaches only
standalone/bootstrap consumers (§2 four-link exclusion); RACE-1 reaches
ONLY the pre-publication watcher chain (§2 scope note); RACE-3 reaches
EVERY apply-path (APPLY-class) reader via the recovered confirm timer
PRE-gate — POST-gate (work item G) all timer dispatch is ordered after
startup, collapsing those rows back to plain APPLY-serialized, with the
atomic cell as the uniform defense. Everything not labeled with a live
exposure is converted for uniformity, not reachability. The compiler
(field retype) proves the conversion total; this table is the
classification snapshot.

### 5.5 Docs contract

- `pkg/daemon/README.md`: publication-cell contract in the ARCHITECTURE
  section (:13); update the bootstrap-mode bullet (:556-568), the
  first-commit rollback bullet (:578-585), AND the live
  `d.dp.ApplyConfig` reference (:936) (r2 Codex MINOR 3).
- Source comments contradicting the rollback recurrence get reworded in
  the same PR: `daemon_run_naming.go:200-206` ("one-way ... at most once"),
  `bootstrap.go:284-289` ("one-way for the daemon's lifetime"),
  `daemon_apply.go:213-220` ("Exit is one-way"), plus the r3 additions
  `daemon.go:901`, `bootstrap.go:276` ("written once at startup and at most
  once more"), `bootstrap.go:303` ("re-suppress takeover for the daemon's
  lifetime"), `cluster_topology_preflight.go:117`'s stale
  `daemon_run.go:1868` cite (now `daemon_run_bringup.go:164`), plus the r4
  additions `daemon_apply_commit.go:156` ("one-way"),
  `daemon_natpoolalarm.go:88` ("exactly once" vs discard-and-rearm at
  `:118-126`), `cluster_topology_preflight.go:59` (second stale
  `daemon_run.go:1868` cite), plus the r5 stale-cite additions
  `pkg/daemon/cluster_identity_preflight_6192_test.go:27` and
  `docs/ha-no-hitless-restart.md:85,130` — the recurrence (exit →
  `enterBootstrapMode` → re-exit) is real and now tested; the comments must
  say "one-way per bootstrap episode; rollback can re-enter" (r2-r5 Codex
  comment sweeps).
- `docs/` sweep: `docs/ha-failover-status.md:279`,
  `docs/ha-no-hitless-restart.md:22`, `docs/rib-group-route-leaking.md:94`
  (the /engineer pass greps `docs/` for `d\.dp` and updates or justifies
  each hit).
- `_Log.md` entries for every implementation edit (CLAUDE.md).

## 6. Public API preservation

`Daemon` and its field are package-private; nothing outside `pkg/daemon`
references them.

**Intentional signature change (the only one)**: `fwdstatus.NewSampler`
takes `CachedStatusProvider` instead of `DataPlaneAccessor` (r2 M1).
Callers: exactly one production (`daemon_run.go:595`) + two test sites
(`sampler_test.go:69,106`); the test fake already satisfies the narrow
interface. `DataPlaneAccessor`/`Build`/`Format` are unchanged for their
real consumers (grpcapi/cli adapters).

Preserved exactly:

- gRPC/CLI `show chassis forwarding` output (their per-request adapters
  untouched; no type divergence against an immutable captured object).
- Sampler behavior: worker counters hold-last on `ok=false` (unchanged code
  path, now a direct call instead of an assertion).
- `conntrack.NewGC` capture at boot; boot probe results
  (`cliDataPlane`/`grpcDataPlane`/`apiDataPlane`).
- NAT pool-alarm monitor lifecycle (#2116) and `show security alarms`.
- NoDataplane mode: cell nil for the daemon lifetime.
- `applyResult()`, health endpoint, REST simulator fail-closed `ok=false`
  (#3414).

## 7. Hidden invariants the change must preserve

1. **Snapshot boundaries per §5.3** — the one way to introduce a NEW bug in
   a mechanical conversion.
2. **Publication atomicity (RACE-1)**: boot writers publish via the cell in
   the same program order; readers see nil or the full slot — never a torn
   interface.
3. **Capture-once semantics**: GC/event-stream captures keep the object
   grabbed at start (same as today). Deliberately preserved.
4. **applySem orthogonality**: lock-free accessor; no lock-ordering
   interaction with the "Locked" conventions.
5. **#2116 monitor lifecycle**: sampler closure switches to the accessor;
   gating/discard untouched; existing race tests re-point `writeDPFor` at
   `setDataplane`.
6. **Terminal nil**: nothing re-publishes a backend on current master; the
   accessor is correct under ANY Store sequence; tests assert observable
   post-nil state without relying on terminality for safety.
7. **Typed-nil exclusion without panic**: kind-gated guard over ALL
   nillable kinds (§4 A1); a value-type implementation Stores normally; a
   typed-nil of any nillable kind (pointer, named slice/map/chan/func)
   Stores as nil. All shapes covered by unit tests (r2 B1, r3 m1).
8. **Shutdown ordering** (#5807): two snapshots per §5.3 rule 5; post-nil
   shutdown skips final stats exactly as today.
9. **Allocation rules**: one `dpSlot` per Store (≤5/lifetime); zero per
   read. Go control plane only.
10. **Retirement boundary**: the canary's invariant (daemon holds a
    `dataplane.RuntimeDataPlane` built by `NewRuntimeDataPlane`) preserved
    through the redesigned matcher; both-direction canary self-tests (§4).

## 8. Risk assessment

| Class | Rating | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Behavioral regression | **MED** | Large but mechanical diff; compiler-enforced completeness + regenerated §5.4 table + the new dpCell canary. Real risks: (a) a §5.3 snapshot-boundary mistake; (b) canary redesign errors (mitigated by both-direction self-tests); (c) the fwdstatus narrowing touching `NewSampler` (contained: 1 prod caller + 2 test sites; full-suite gate). |
| Lifetime / borrow | **LOW** | Immutable slots; captured references keep backends alive exactly as today. No FFI/Rust interaction. |
| Performance regression | **LOW** | One atomic load + indirection per control-plane read (1 Hz sampler, request rate, watchdog 2/s, HA ≤15/s). One small allocation per Store, ≤5/lifetime. No per-packet Go code. |
| Architectural mismatch | **LOW** | #2116 `atomic.Pointer` precedent; daemon atomics-for-publication idiom; no dataplane-lifecycle redesign (Option B rejected); canary redesign extends the existing boundary-guard pattern. Work item G IS a deliberate lifecycle change (startup-outcome gating of the rollback executor) — scoped, ~40 LoC + tests, with its own invariants: startup-outcome handled on EVERY exit path (no goroutine leak on failure leg, no rollback against partial init); gate-before-applySem ordering (no deadlock vs the boot apply); timer-retention on abandon is INTENTIONAL (the persisted confirm record is re-resolved by the next boot's expired-window path, `store_persist.go:225-228`). |

## 9. Test plan

1. `go build ./... && go vet ./pkg/daemon/... ./pkg/fwdstatus/...` — the
   field retype makes the compiler enumerate every conversion site.
2. New `pkg/daemon/daemon_dp_race_test.go` (under `-race`, `-count=5`):
   - `TestDataplaneCell_ConcurrentReadersVsWriter` — N goroutines hammer
     accessor-routed readers (narrowed adapter `CachedStatus`,
     `applyResult()`, a `PolicySchedulerActiveStateFn`-shape probe, the NAT
     pool sampler closure, a watchdog-shape per-tick load) while a writer
     alternates `setDataplane(nil)` / `setDataplane(fake)`. Revert-guard.
   - `TestDataplaneCell_TypedNilAndValueShapes` (r2 B1, r3+r4 broadened) —
     TABLE-DRIVEN over every guarded nillable kind: typed-nil pointer,
     typed-nil named slice, typed-nil named map, typed-nil named chan,
     typed-nil named func (each Stores as nil, `d.dataplane() == nil`);
     plus a value-receiver fake (Stores normally, no panic, non-nil read).
   - `TestForwardingStatusAdapter_BackendTypeTransitions` — start
     `readyProbeOnlyFake` (adapter `CachedStatus` ok=false) →
     `setDataplane(userspaceFake)` (ok=true, injected status) →
     `setDataplane(nil)` (ok=false). Proves per-call capability adaptation;
     the OLD construction-time wrapper selection (base wrapper permanently
     lacking `CachedStatus`, or nil accessor when nil-at-construction,
     `daemon_forwarding_status.go:123-125`) cannot express the middle leg.
   - `TestBootstrapExit_ArmFailureWithConcurrentReaders` — REAL writer via
     the extracted `armBootstrapExitDataplane(nodeID int)` helper
     (Start + seeder + `maybeStartNATPoolAlarm` + nil-on-failure, split
     from `runBootstrapExitStartup` so the test avoids the netlink/sysctl
     takeover steps); failing-Start fake; churn readers; assert `-race`
     clean, `d.dataplane() == nil`, monitor not started.
   - `TestBootstrapExit_RealSamplerOverlap` (r2 M2, r3 B1 — the barrier
     must NOT happens-before-order the conflicting accesses): the adapter's
     `CachedStatus` loads `d.dataplane()` BEFORE invoking the provider, so
     a gate inside the provider's `CachedStatus` would serialize
     `read(d.dp) → entered → writer`, keeping even the pre-fix plain field
     race-clean (silent green). The gate must therefore sit BEFORE the
     `d.dp` access on BOTH sides with NO channel between the two
     conflicting accesses:
     - Reader side: the fake `ProcReader.ReadSelfStat` (which
       `Sampler.sample()` calls before touching the adapter,
       `sampler.go:93`) signals `readerEntered` and blocks on a shared
       `release` channel. `go fwdSampler.Start(ctx)` — `Start` MUST run on
       its own goroutine because its prime sample is synchronous
       (`sampler.go:64-67`).
     - Writer side: the failing fake dataplane's `Start()` signals
       `writerEntered` and blocks on the SAME `release` before returning
       its error (the `setDataplane(nil)` store happens after `Start`
       returns in `armBootstrapExitDataplane`).
     - Test: wait for BOTH `readerEntered` and `writerEntered`, then
       `close(release)`. The adapter's `d.dp` load and the writer's store
       now proceed with no happens-before edge between them: on the plain
       field the race detector fires (only the ABSENCE of an HB edge is
       required — deterministic as a memory-model proposition, not a
       timing one); on the atomic cell it is clean.
     - Teardown: the sampler loop exposes no join handle (`Start` returns
       nothing) — `cancel(ctx)` and then require SUSTAINED quiescence: the
       fake `ProcReader` records `ReadSelfStat` entries under a mutex and
       returns a successful stat; the test polls the counter until it has
       been stable for ≥ 2× `SampleInterval` (≥2.5 s margin at the 1 s
       cadence) — bounded by an overall test timeout so it cannot hang.
   - `TestDataplaneCell_RollbackRearmRecurrence` — real helpers: successful
     arm → monitor starts → `enterBootstrapMode` (discarded) → re-exit with
     failing Start → `d.dataplane() == nil`, no monitor, `-race` clean with
     watchdog-shape readers churning.
   - `TestDataplaneCell_ClusterStartPublication` — RACE-1 shape:
     watcher-shape reader loop racing the boot `setDataplane(dp)`
     publication; nil-or-full-slot assertion; `-race` clean.
   - `TestDataplaneCell_ConfirmTimerVsBootPublication` — RACE-3 + work
     item G (r5 pivot, r6-strengthened):
     (a) GATE test: with `startupDone` OPEN, a fired
     `executeConfirmedRollback` must BLOCK before applySem — assert no
     rollback side effects AND that a second goroutine CAN acquire and
     release `d.applySem` while the executor is gated (an implementation
     that takes applySem THEN waits would deadlock the boot apply; this
     assertion kills it). Then: close with `startupOK=true` ⇒ rollback
     proceeds; close with `startupOK=false` (failure leg) ⇒ abandon with
     no side effects and no leaked waiter.
     (b) Cell revert-guard, post-startup shape: two-sided gate — a
     `setDataplane(dp)` publication gated immediately before the store vs
     an applySem-holding reader gated immediately before its
     `d.dataplane()` load; shared release; no channel between the pair.
     (c) REAL-path ordering test: a fake `RuntimeDataPlane` (NOT
     NoDataplane — that skips the boot writer/arm path), a stubbed
     persisted confirm record, and a deterministic post-`Load`/
     pre-`initManagers` startup seam (a phase-hook var for tests): fire
     the timer while startup is paused, assert NO dispatch (gate holds),
     resume startup, assert dispatch lands after the linearization point
     with the fake dataplane intact (pre-gate the dispatch would touch
     `d.vrrpMgr` — nil before construction — and interleave the boot
     writer).
3. Update `daemon_natpoolalarm_race_test.go` (`writeDPFor` →
   `setDataplane`) and `daemon_forwarding_status_test.go` (rewrite against
   the narrowed adapter: `ProjectsMapStats`/`UsesUserspaceStatusAdapter`
   move to asserting `CachedStatus` per-call probing;
   `UsesCurrentDataplaneAfterSwap` maps onto the narrowed shape with
   `setDataplane` swaps).
4. Scoped race gate: new `test-race-dp` make target —
   `go test -race ./pkg/daemon/ -run 'DataplaneCell|NATPoolAlarm|ForwardingStatus|BootstrapExit' -count=2`
   — invoked from `test-go` (r1/r2: plain `go test ./...` has no race
   teeth; full-repo `-race` stays out of scope).
5. Canary tests: redesigned matcher self-tests both directions; new
   `daemon_dp_canary_test.go` asserts no direct `dpCell` access outside the
   accessors.
6. `make test` explicitly (Go + Rust legs), plus the full Go suite.
7. Smoke gates (engineering-style.md:93-103 — NOT waivable; r2 Codex M6
   specifics folded):
   - `make test-deploy` on the standalone VM + ping with **0% loss**.
   - `make cluster-deploy` on the loss userspace cluster, then RE-APPLY CoS
     (`./test/incus/apply-cos-config.sh loss:xpf-userspace-fw0` — deploy
     wipes CoS, engineering-style.md:422), then `iperf3 -P 16 -t 30 -p 5203`
     to `172.16.80.200` with **≥23 Gbit/s, no regression** vs the pre-change
     baseline.
   - `make test-failover` AND `make test-ha-crash` (mechanical
     `daemon_ha*.go` touches mandate both per CLAUDE.md), with explicit
     HA loss/convergence criteria recorded in the PR (failover <1s traffic
     loss, cluster reconverges, no stale dataplane state) — all under the
     #1875/`with-cluster.sh` lock discipline.
8. Bootstrap-window coverage stays unit/`-race`-level (no bootstrap
   integration env; same as #2116).

## 10. Out of scope (explicitly)

- Option B (write-once `d.dp` / degraded-adapter semantics).
- Swapping capture-once consumers (GC, event stream) to per-tick re-probe.
- `pkg/grpcapi` / `pkg/cli` boot-captured forwarding-status probes (stale
  after a daemon-side transition, never racy — separate consistency
  follow-up if wanted).
- The `apply.go:29` TODO (HA session sync → `SessionDeltas()` migration).
- `pkg/fwdstatus` `Build`/`Format` internals (the ONLY fwdstatus change is
  the `CachedStatusProvider` narrowing in `sampler.go` + its test).
- Any Rust/helper change; dataplane hot-swap/re-arm support (the accessor
  ENABLES it safely later).
- Full-repo `go test -race` wiring.
- **Legacy-path hardening (r6 follow-up issue, filed at /engineer time)**:
  behavior-level handling of the cross-upgrade coexistence (§2 r6
  boundary) — either guarding recovery against `FirstCommit`+cluster
  confirm records (resolve-as-expired rather than rolling back into
  bootstrap-with-cluster), or stopping cluster comms in
  `enterBootstrapMode` when `d.cluster != nil`. The publication fix
  removes the crash vector on this path; the coexistence BEHAVIOR is a
  pre-existing configstore/recovery policy question, not a `d.dp`
  publication concern.

## 11. Open questions for adversarial review (r7)

Resolved in v2-v7 (for the record): A2 deletion; atomic cell choice;
sampler-only adapter — now STRUCTURAL via `CachedStatusProvider`;
policy-invalidate APPLY-class; HA smoke gates mandatory + specific;
typed-nil kind-gated guard over all nillable kinds with a table-driven
matrix; docs scope (README architecture + :936 + docs/ sweep + stale
comments incl. the r3/r4/r5 additions + `_Log.md`); audit table
completeness AND exact count (134 = 5 + 129) with consistent per-row
exposure cells; deterministic real-sampler barrier as a two-sided gate
with a bounded sustained-quiescence teardown; bootstrap/cluster exclusion
scoped to current-version records with the r6 cross-upgrade coexistence
documented; RACE-1 scoped to the pre-publication watcher chain INCLUDING
the blackhole→readiness hop; RACE-3 (recovered commit-confirmed rollback
timer) documented; the pre-existing startup-ordering defect it exposed
(nil-deref `d.vrrpMgr`, bootstrap-armed interleaving) addressed by work
item G, REDESIGNED as an exactly-once startup outcome (`startupDone` +
`startupOK`, constructor-initialized, linearization before server
exposure, fixture migration, contract-comment updates); work item G kept
IN the PR (both r6 reviewers concur; Codex allows a separate prerequisite
commit in the same stack).

Still open:

1. **PLAN-KILL fork**: with RACE-1 (watcher chain), RACE-2 (bootstrap-exit)
   and RACE-3 (recovered confirm timer) all proven structural, does any
   reviewer still judge the ~244-site conversion (134 prod + ~110 test)
   unjustified? A PLAN-KILL here means accepting all three races as
   documented known-issues — state the reasoning explicitly if so.
2. The `CachedStatusProvider` narrowing (§4 A1) is the one intentional
   public-signature change (`fwdstatus.NewSampler`). Any objection, or an
   alternative that keeps the adapter structurally excluded from `Build`
   without touching `pkg/fwdstatus`?
3. The `armBootstrapExitDataplane` extraction splits
   `runBootstrapExitStartup` for testability. Any objection to the helper
   boundary (naming/sysctl stay in the caller; arm+seed+monitor+nil in the
   helper)?
4. The new `dpCell`-access AST canary in `pkg/daemon` — accepted
   enforcement mechanism (precedent: the retirement canary), or do
   reviewers want a lighter `grep`-based `make` check instead?
5. `test-race-dp` wiring into `test-go`: acceptable growth of the
   pre-commit gate, or documented-manual-gate only?
6. **Work item G kept IN this PR** (both r6 reviewers concur). Remaining
   sub-question: single commit vs separate prerequisite commit in the same
   stack (Codex's suggestion for reviewability)?
7. **Legacy-path hardening** (§10): confirm the follow-up-issue split
   (guard recovery against `FirstCommit`+cluster records, or stop cluster
   comms in `enterBootstrapMode` when `d.cluster != nil`) rather than
   folding it into this PR.
