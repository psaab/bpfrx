## Parse-Only Features Summary

These features have config parsing in bpfrx but NO runtime effect:

| # | Config Path | Type | Notes |
|---|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | `security pre-id-default-policy` | PreIDDefaultPolicy | Requires AppID engine |

## Implementation Suggestions for Top Gaps

### Proxy ARP for NAT (Tier 1)
- Implement in `pkg/dataplane/` or `pkg/networkd/`
- When SNAT pool or DNAT address is on same subnet as ingress interface, auto-respond to ARP/NDP
- Can use raw socket AF_PACKET (like GARP in cluster.go) or `ip neigh add proxy`

### Session Limiting (Tier 1)
- Add `limit-session` to ScreenProfile struct and compiler
- Implement per-source-IP and per-dest-IP session counting in BPF conntrack
- Use per-CPU hash map for session counts, check in xdp_conntrack before creating new session

### Firewall Filter Policers (Tier 1) — IMPLEMENTED (Sprint FF-1)
- Single-rate two-color + three-color (RFC 2697/2698) policers in BPF
- Token-bucket with per-CPU state maps; flexible match conditions; lo0 filter wiring

### BFD (Tier 1)
- FRR already has `bfdd` daemon
- Add BFD config to OSPFInterface, BGPNeighbor types
- Generate BFD peer config in FRR frr.conf
- Minimal bpfrx code change - mostly FRR config generation

### NETCONF (Tier 1)
- Consider using `openconfig/gnmic` or `netopeer2` for NETCONF server
- Map to existing gRPC RPCs for config get/set
- YANG models can be generated from existing config types
